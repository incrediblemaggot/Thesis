	title = {Key {factors} for the {emergence} of {collective} {decision} in {invertebrates}},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {In many species of group living invertebrates, in particular arthropods, collective decisions can emerge from the combined actions of individuals and the direct or indirect interactions between individuals. These decisions allow groups of individuals to respond quickly and accurately to changes that occur in their environment. Examples of such decisions are found in a variety of invertebrate taxa and in many different contexts, e.g., exploring a new territory, foraging for food, finding a suitable location where to aggregate or to establish a nest, defending oneself against predators, etc. In this paper we review the collective decisions that have been documented in different invertebrate taxa where individuals are known to live temporarily or permanently in social or gregarious groups. We first present some simple examples of collective decisions involving the choice between two alternatives. We then define the fundamental rules required for these collective decisions to emerge throughout the invertebrate taxon, from simple organisms such as caterpillars, to animals endowed with highly developed perceptive and cognitive capacities such as ants and bees. The presentation of these rules gives us the opportunity to illustrate one of the pitfalls of the study of collective choice in animals by showing through computer simulations how a choice between two alternatives can be misinterpreted as the result of the action of self-organized mechanisms. In the second part, we discuss the peculiarities of collective decisions in invertebrates, their properties, and characteristics. We conclude by discussing the issue of individual complexity in collective decision-making process.},

	abstract = {In primates, authors have reported the specific organization of individuals during collective movements. Some authors have suggested that intentional mechanisms underlie this particular organization because primates have high cognitive abilities that can allow them to use this kind of behaviour. However, mechanisms underlying the emergence of complex systems are not necessarily complex and can be based on local rules. We investigated the joining processes observed during collective movements in one semifree-ranging group of Tonkean macaques, using an individualized agent-based model. The complex patterns observed, such as departure latencies, associations and order of individuals at departure of a collective movement, could be explained using a rule based on affiliative relationships. The decision an individual took to join the movement depended on the departure of its strongly affiliated individuals. Thus even in primates, complex collective behaviour may emerge from interactions between individuals following local behavioural rules.},

Lepisma saccharina did not respond to the pheromone of C. longicaudata, nor to that of another thysanuran, the firebrat Thermobia domestica. However, C. longicaudata responded to pheromones of both L. saccharina and T. domestica, whereas T. domestica responded to the C. longicaudata but not L. saccharina pheromone. These results support the hypothesis that a closer phylogenetic relationship exists between C. longicaudata and T. domestica than between C. longicaudata and L. saccharina, but a definitive conclusion must await molecular genetic analyses of all three species.},

Sometimes the positive photoreaction occurs only at high temperatures (Porcellio), a pattern of behavior correlated with thermoregulation by evaporative cooling. Similarly, in mesic species the response to humidity becomes less significant than in littoral species, resuming importance mainly when the isopods become dehydrated (Armadillidium).Finally, in isopods from xeric habitats in semi-arid and desert regions (Armadillo, Venezillo), photoreaction is strongly negative except in Hemilepistus at lower temperatures. All of these isopods are positively hygrokinetic only at low humidities and are strongly negatively thermoactive, indicating a drop in activity at high temperatures. The photonegative response in these isopods is stronger than the hygroreaction.},

In the first series of experiments, animals became more aggregated (Clarke and Evans’ R) as the population density (p) was increased. The rate of aggregation (dR/dp) was greater when the species were mixed than when they were separate. In the second series of experiments, activity, total encounters, and resolved encounters, were highest in paired P. bernhardus, lower in mixed pairs of the two species, and lowest in pairs of P. prideauxi. Larger individuals were more active than smaller ones in P. bernhardus and P. prideauxi pairs. In the mixed pairs, P. bernhardus were more active. Paired P. bernhardus were slightly more active than isolated P. bernhardus but this difference was not statistically significant. The activities of paired and isolated P. prideauxi were not significantly different. The distances between individuals in pairs were similar for all combinations.

	abstract = {Summary
Decisions reached through consensus are often more accurate, because they efficiently utilize the diverse information possessed by group members [1–3]. A trust in consensus decision making underlies many of our democratic political and judicial institutions [4], as well as the design of web tools such as Google, Wikipedia, and prediction markets [5, 6]. In theory, consensus for the option favored by the majority of group members will lead to improved decision-making accuracy as group size increases [2, 4]. Although group-living animals are known to utilize social information [7–10], little is known about whether or not decision accuracy increases with group size. In order to reach consensus, group members must be able to integrate the disparate information they possess. Positive feedback, resulting from copying others, can spread information quickly through the group, but it can also result in all individuals making the same, possibly incorrect, choice [8, 11, 12]. On the other hand, if individuals never copy each other, their decision making remains independent and they fail to benefit from information exchange [4]. Here, we show how small groups of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) reach consensus when choosing which of two replica fish to follow. As group size increases, the fish make more accurate decisions, becoming better at discriminating subtle phenotypic differences of the replicas. A simple quorum rule proves sufficient to explain our observations, suggesting that animals can make accurate decisions without the need for complicated comparison of the information they possess. Furthermore, although submission to peers can lead to occasional cascades of incorrect decisions, these can be explained as a byproduct of what is usually accurate consensus decision making.},

In 2-choice tests involving simple Y mazes constructed from these paper strips, the caterpillars of both species preferred by approximately 3∶1 the trails of the FTC. Studies involving whole colonies of the ETC maintained under nearnatural conditions in the laboratory, however, indicated that the trails deposited by successful foragers of the ETC as they returned to their tent from feeding sites were more attractive than the exploratory trails of either the ETC or FTC. The pronounced interspecific response of these congeners to each other's trails suggests that they utilize either qualitatively similar or identical trail-marking chemicals. Both species preferred their own trails to those ofArchips cerasivoranus (Fitch) (Tortricidae), providing the first evidence that more distantly related lepidopterous larvae utilize distinct trails.},

These findings have stimulated engineers to investigate approaches for the coordination of autonomous multirobot systems based on self-organization.

Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions. Even when in the minority, robots can modulate the collective decision-making process and produce a global pattern not observed in their absence.

	abstract = {We investigated whether different species of birds associated with each other while foraging during the breeding season. On average 50\% of foraging observations were in mixed-species foraging aggregations, but with extensive interspecific variation. The occurrence of mixed-species foraging aggregations was relatively constant from the end of May until early July, with no indication that the appearance of fledglings increased the frequency of aggregations. These mixed-species foraging aggregations consisted of a wide variety of species in terms of foraging niche: typical flycatchers specialized arboreal insectivores, and generalists were observed foraging together. The titmice species (Parus spp.) seemed to be preferred as foraging companions. The sites where foraging aggregations were observed did not differ from an equal number of randomly chosen sites with respect to forest vegetation structure. The dispersion of individuals in study areas was analysed using a 50 m x 50 m quadrat as the sampling unit. Altogether, 96 quadrats were surveyed. The dispersion of individual birds with respect to individuals of other species was non-random, and significantly clumped within quadrats. We used two playback experiments to test whether the aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions. In the first experiment, 20 randomly assigned sites received two 10-min treatments: willow tit (Parus montanus) song and silence as control. In the second experiment, we had two control treatments at 30 playback sites for the willow tit song, the song of the olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus borealis) and classical music. More species were observed during willow tit song than during any of the controls. This suggests that aggregated dispersion pattern and the existence of mixed-species foraging aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions, and also that recognition of neighbouring species was involved. We suggest that birds actively aggregate in mixed-species foraging groups to gain protection against predators and/or enhance feeding efficiency. The results support the view that positive interactions have an importance in structuring northern breeding bird communities.},

Blowflies are economically important agents of sheep myiasis in the UK and understanding local aggregation is an essential step in the development of appropriate sampling and fly control regimes. Fifty, 20 x 20 cm, non-odour-baited, sticky traps were used to catch flies, at randomized, 10 x 10 m grid co-ordinates in fields of permanent pasture. Clear aggregations were evident in all Lucilia distributions. All values of the sigma2:mean ratio were greater than 1. The catches were shown to be highly aggregated using Morisita's index of aggregation. Generalized linear modelling of binary presence/absence catch data was used to relate aggregation to microclimate and habitat. Deletion testing was used to identify significant terms in the models. In general, Lucilia blowflies were predominantly caught around the edges, in warmer and more humid areas of the field. The relationship between microhabitat and the distribution of Lucilia collected in 1999 was used as predictive model to explain the catches made in two fields in 2000. This gave a highly significant fit in one field (P = 0.001) and a relationship which approached significance in the second (P = 0.08). However, these regressions suggest that the relationships between abundance and microhabitat are complex and that 'hot spots' of blowfly catches were not necessarily found in the most extreme microclimate conditions. Nevertheless, microhabitat features do give a relatively good guide to presence or absence of Lucilia in the trap catches, thereby providing important information about the most appropriate location of traps to maximize and standardize sampling and control regimes.},

	abstract = {In homospecific groups of ants, each species has its own hydrocarbon profile, on the epicuticle and in the postpharyngeal gland (PPG). When reared together in bispecific groups, workers of both species possess each other's hydrocarbons in both locations. The present study investigated two alternative mechanisms by which a mixed “odour” in artificial groups ofFormica selysi/Manica rubida can be created. Using [1-14C] sodium acetate as a precursor,de novo biosynthesis of hydrocarbons was demonstrated for both species whether reared in homospecific or mixed-species groups. The newly synthesized hydrocarbons occurred on the epicuticle, internally, and in particularly large amounts in the PPG. As expected from their PPG and epicuticular hydrocarbons composition, workersF. selysi synthesized alkanes and alkenes in comparable amounts irrespective of their rearing scheme. Likewise,M. rubida reared in bispecific groups synthesized mostly alkanes with only negligible amounts of alkenes, according to a ratio characteristic toM. rubida workers from homospecific groups and not toF. selysi workers. During dyadic encounters, a transfer of labeled hydrocarbons between nestmates (conspecific in homospecific groups and allospecific in mixed groups) was observed. These results suggest that the formation of the mixed hydrocarbon profile in artificial groups of ants is the result of a transfer of these chemicals between nestmates rather thande novo biosynthesis of the allospecific hydrocarbons. Behaviours like trophallaxis, grooming and body contact that occurred during the encounters mediated such a transfer.},

	abstract = {Spatial distribution of scarabeoid beetles on dung pats was studied in the Argentera Natural Park (south-western Italian Alps) from June to September in 1994 and 1995. Artificial dung pats were distributed evenly within the study area (about 1400 m a.s.l.) and sampled at suitable dung ages (1–13 days). Two experimental tests were carried out. In the first test, experimental pats were covered with metallic nets which prevented the largest species from reaching the dung, whilst in the second test a variable number of individuals of large or relatively large species was added to the experimental pats.The community was dominated by Aphodius species (19 out of 25 species), which usually were also the most abundant in the pats. The densities of most species were relatively low most of the time with average abundances lower than two individuals per pat. Even though some interspecific differences were observed, ecological overlap between species was rather high with regard both to seasonality and succession in the dropping. Manipulative tests suggested that small beetles were not excluded by larger beetles. Patterns of spatial distribution showed some degree of intra- and interspecific aggregation. Proximate mechanisms of aggregation are probably non-specific. The ultimate cause of aggregation might be mate-finding. Alternatively, individuals might aggregate because the very same presence of beetles within a dung pat would modify its chemical status improving its quality. Intraspecific aggregation (measured by means of the J index) was much higher than interspecific aggregation (C index) which suggests, according to the Aggregation Model, that interspecific coexistence might be facilitated. However, the data gave no evidence for intra- and interspecific competition between adult beetles.},

	abstract = {Aggregation is one of the most basic social phenomena, and many activities of social insects are linked to it. For instance, the selection of a valuable site and the spatial organization of the population are very often by-products of amplifications based on the local density of nestmates. The patterns of aggregation are very diverse, ranging from the gathering of all animals in a unique site to their splitting between several ones. One might question how these multiple patterns emerge. Do ants actively initiate the formation of such patterns by modulating the emission of an attracting signal such as the trail pheromone? Alternatively, do patterns result from quantitative changes in the duration of interaction between animals once they have reached the gathering site, without any active modulation of the communications? To discuss these questions, we present two empirical studies: the gregarious behavior of cockroaches (Blatella) and self-assembly in the weaver ant (Oecophylla). Through experimental and theoretical studies, we show how a single behavior--the resting time--leads to a collective choice in both species. This behavior is a response to the density of conspecifics and can also be modulated by heterogeneities in the environment. In weaver ants, it allows the colony to focus the formation of chains in a given area among several potential sites. In cockroaches, it allows the gathering of individuals in particular shelters, depending on the proximity between strains. These results are discussed with emphasis on the role of aggregation processes in the emergence of cooperativity and task allocation.},

	abstract = {In spiny lobsters, conspecific scents (“aggregation cues”) may mediate gregarious diurnal sheltering, but scents from injured conspecifics (“alarm odors”) may elicit avoidance behavior. In laboratory experiments, individuals of two coexisting species, Panulirus guttatus (a reef-obligate) and P. argus (a temporary reef-dweller), significantly chose shelters emanating conspecific aggregation cues and responded randomly to shelters emanating heterospecific aggregation cues. However, despite evidence that the two species perceived each other's alarm odors to a similar extent, P. guttatus responded randomly to shelters emanating either conspecific or heterospecific alarm odors, whereas P. argus significantly avoided both. This differential influence of alarm odors likely reflects interspecific differences in life history, sociality, and behavior. The less social, reef-obligate P. guttatus lobsters forage close to their reef dens, into which they retract deeply upon perception of risk. This cryptic behavior may offset the need to avoid conspecific (and heterospecific) alarm odors. In contrast, avoidance of conspecific alarm odors by P. argus is consistent with its ontogenetic habitat shifts and greater sociality. Furthermore, because reef-dwelling P. argus lobsters forage across open areas away from the reef, an ability to avoid alarm odors from P. guttatus upon returning to their reef dens may increase their fitness.},

An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.},

various body regions to identify the site of mechanosensory input that
elicits the transition to gregarious phase behavior. The phase state of
individual insects was measured after a 4-h period of localized
mechanical stimulation, by using a behavioral assay based on multiple
logistic regression analysis. A significant switch from solitarious to
gregarious behavior occurred when the outer face of a hind femur had
been stimulated, but mechanical stimulation of 10 other body regions
did not result in significant behavioral change. We conclude that a
primary cause of the switch in behavior that seeds the formation of
locust swarms is individuals regularly touching others on the hind legs
within populations that have become concentrated by the environment.},

	abstract = {The selfish herd hypothesis predicts that aggregations form because individuals move towards one another, and that this movement will minimize predation risk as measured by the domain of danger. To test the predictions of the selfish herd hypothesis in the field, we videotaped the movements of sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, flocks being attacked by predators. After recording 12 attacks on crabs by shorebird and human attackers, we digitized the video, and determined the positions of crabs before and after being frightened. We estimated the time of panic initiation by the rapid increase in the crabs' velocity. Crab flocks became more cohesive after panic initiation. The frequency distribution of the crabs' domains of danger shifted significantly towards smaller domains after panic initiation. The median domain of danger was significantly lower after panic initiation than beforehand. Two other indices of aggregation also showed statistically significant increases in flock cohesion following panic initiation. We conclude that fiddler crab behaviour is consistent with the selfish herd hypothesis. Therefore, our results support the selfish herd hypothesis as an explanation for gregarious behaviour.

Individual \textit{P. guttatus} showed no den preference in treatments 1 and 2, preferred the cave in 3 and 4, and always preferred the cave vault. Presence of congeners did not affect den choice or cave position for either species, whereas the predator affected den choice (\textit{P. guttatus} only) and position in caves (both species). Videotapes showed aggression between individual \textit{P. guttatus} but not between individual \textit{P. argus} or between species.

Here we elucidate the role of olfactory cues in earthworm attraction to food sources and document specific chemical cues that attract Eisenia fetida to the soil fungi Geotrichum candidum. Fungi and other microorganisms are major sources of volatile emissions in soil ecosystems as well as primary food sources for earthworms, suggesting the likelihood that earthworms might profitably use olfactory cues to guide foraging behavior. Moreover, previous studies have documented earthworm movement toward microbial food sources. But, the specific olfactory cues responsible for earthworm attraction have not previously been identified. Using olfactometer assays combined with chemical analyses (GC-MS), we documented the attraction of E. fetida individuals to filtrate derived from G. candidum colonies and to two individual compounds tested in isolation: ethyl pentanoate and ethyl hexanoate. Attraction at a distance was observed when barriers prevented the worms from reaching the target stimuli, confirming the role of volatile cues. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying key trophic interactions in soil ecosystems and have potential implications for the extraction and collection of earthworms in vermiculture and other applied activities.},

	shorttitle = {Mixed flocks and polyspecific associations},
	abstract = {This review examines the diversity of avian mixed foraging flocks with the goal of relating the conclusions to primate polyspecific associations. Mixed associations are considered as adaptations for achieving an optimal balance between predator protection and feeding efficiency. In open habitat, predator and prey are able to detect each other at a distance and feeding competition is low, especially in species that subsist on a homogeneously distributed food supply. These conditions favor large groups of variable composition. In closed habitats, predators attack at close range, so early warning alarm systems are at a premium. Feeding competition is often intense because food resources such as fruit, flushing leaves, and nectar are spatially concentrated. Since feeding competition is generally less between than within species, these conditions favor mixed associations composed of small numbers of several to many species, and the evolution of elaborate early warning systems to thwart predators. The primate polyspecific associations that have been studied to date share characteristics with the closed habitat model while exhibiting some important distinctions. Primate associations are made up of integral troops, not individuals, implying high incremental costs of joining. These costs, plus a paucity of ecologically compatible combinations of species, seem to limit primate polyspecific associations geographically to regions in which the presence of monkey-eating raptors provides a strong incentive for aggregation.},

	abstract = {Three geographical strains of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina, were tested for cold tolerance at 0°, −4° and −8°C. Survival to eclosion after 1 to 18 days of cold exposure was greater for diapause-destined larvae than for nondiapause-destined larvae of the two northern strains (Nallikari, Finland 65°N and Edinburgh, Scotland 55°N) but not for the southernmost strain (Barga, Italy 44°N) where no clear differences were apparent. Diapause-destined larvae of the Edinburgh strain were more cold tolerant than those from Nallikari, at both −4° and −8°C, a difference possibly attributable to the long-lasting snow cover in the more northern locality, which might insulate the overwintering soil microclimate. At 0°C, however, Nallikari larvae were more cold tolerant than Edinburgh or Barga. This was also the case for nondiapause-destined larvae, indicating that cold tolerance may occur, in part, independently of the diapause programme. In all three strains diapausing larvae were more cold tolerant than same-age (nondiapausing) pupae. For Nallikari, but not Barga, wandering larvae from short-day exposed flies, therefore initially programmed for diapause, but diverted from the diapause pathway by larval breeding at 19°C, were significantly more cold tolerant than nondiapause larvae from long-day parents, indicating some maternal regulation of larval cold tolerance. There was, however, no evidence for an additional cold hardiness in larvae acclimatised to cold by a gradual reduction of temperature.},

	abstract = {Multicellular electrophysiological responses from the dorsal organ on the cephalic lobes of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae (wild-type Canton S) stimulated with a cold-trapped banana volatile extract showed that this structure has an olfactory function in the fruit fly. Responses of the dorsal organ were also recorded to constituents of the banana volatile extract as they eluted from a gas chromatographic column (GC-coupled dorsal organ electrophysiology). The active chemostimulants were identified as 2-heptanone, isoamyl alcohol, hexyl acetate, hexanol and hexyl butyrate by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Applying the same recording system to the terminal organ sensilla, no responses were obtained to either the banana volatile bouquet or its constituents. By contrast, high frequency multicellular responses were recorded in response to touching the terminal organ with the gustatory stimuli KCl and grapefruit juice; responses were absent on similar stimulation of the dorsal organ with either NaCl or KCl. This suggests a role for olfaction by the dorsal organ and for gustation by the terminal organ in Drosophila larvae.

In a 7-mm high wind tunnel with a thin 1.2\% agar floor, the Drosophila larvae showed odour-conditioned upwind responses in an air stream of 0.1 m/s bearing banana volatiles. Drosophila larvae responded best to the odour of cut bananas. A 1:1 mixture of the banana odour constituents 2-heptanone and hexanol (at either 50 or 100 μg source dose each) proved as attractive as the known larval attractants propionic acid and isoamyl acetate on their own at 100 μg, whereas hexanol and 2-heptanone on their own at a 100 μg source dose were less attractive. The stronger behavioural response to the banana volatile bouquet and to the binary mixture serves to underline the multireceptor nature of the dorsal organ response to food odour in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {A variety of temperature thresholds for larvae, pupae, and adults of seven African species of carrion-feeding blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was measured and compared to understand their basic thermal biology and the influence of temperature on their behaviour. Calliphora croceipalpis (Jaennicke) had consistently lower temperature thresholds than all other species tested for all larval (42.9 °C), pupal (16.6 °C), and adult (45.6 °C) stages. Larvae (50.1 °C) and adults (53.4 °C) of Chrysomya marginalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) had higher upper lethal temperature thresholds than all other species and weighed more than all other species. Pupae and adults of both Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) and Lucilia sericata (Meigen) had similar temperature thresholds, whereas Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann), Chrysomya chloropyga (Wiedemann), and Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) had inconsistent rank temperature thresholds between the larval, pupal, and adult stages. With a few minor exceptions, the nervous activity, muscle activity, and death thresholds in female adult flies responded at higher temperatures than conspecific male flies for all species tested. Similarly, female adult flies weighed consistently more than conspecific male flies for all species tested, except Ca. croceipalpis. These data suggest that there is a phylogenetic component to the thermal biology of blowflies, because Ca. croceipalpis belongs to a primarily Holarctic genus and shows adaptation to that climate even though it inhabits Africa. Comparisons between these temperature thresholds and the distributions of blowfly species present on three rhinoceros carcasses suggest that blowfly larvae with high upper lethal temperature thresholds (particularly C. marginalis) dominate in interspecific competition on the carcass by raising the temperature of the amassed maggots above the thresholds of other carrion-feeding blowflies, through metabolically generated heat.},

	issn = {1662-4548},
	abstract = {In many species of group living invertebrates, in particular arthropods, collective decisions can emerge from the combined actions of individuals and the direct or indirect interactions between individuals. These decisions allow groups of individuals to respond quickly and accurately to changes that occur in their environment. Examples of such decisions are found in a variety of invertebrate taxa and in many different contexts, e.g., exploring a new territory, foraging for food, finding a suitable location where to aggregate or to establish a nest, defending oneself against predators, etc. In this paper we review the collective decisions that have been documented in different invertebrate taxa where individuals are known to live temporarily or permanently in social or gregarious groups. We first present some simple examples of collective decisions involving the choice between two alternatives. We then define the fundamental rules required for these collective decisions to emerge throughout the invertebrate taxon, from simple organisms such as caterpillars, to animals endowed with highly developed perceptive and cognitive capacities such as ants and bees. The presentation of these rules gives us the opportunity to illustrate one of the pitfalls of the study of collective choice in animals by showing through computer simulations how a choice between two alternatives can be misinterpreted as the result of the action of self-organized mechanisms. In the second part, we discuss the peculiarities of collective decisions in invertebrates, their properties, and characteristics. We conclude by discussing the issue of individual complexity in collective decision-making process.},

The stages examined ranged from eggs to 8-day-old adults. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles revealed that odd linear alkanes dominate in all three species. Short-chain carbon compounds in larvae and post-feeding larvae were seen to evolve to long-chain carbon compounds in pupae and adults. Discriminant analysis of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles showed a clear differentiation among the different stages (larvae, post-feeding larvae, pupae and adults) and within stages, according to the age of individuals. This study concluded that the postmortem interval can be determined from the composition of cuticular waxes in Calliphoridae in forensic situations.},

Koch) (Araneac: Theridiidae). We determined that the spatial distribution of these two spiders was clumped and that H. thorelli had a greater tendency to aggregate than did A. tepidariorum. To determine the mechanism responsible for this spatial pattern, we conducted three field experiments. We examined web-site selection by H. thorelli in three contexts: no spiders or webs present (cue removed), vacant webs present, and occupied webs present. In the case where no webs were present, there was no tendency for spiders to choose previously occupied sites as web sites. When vacant webs were present, spiders chose to occupy the vacant webs. When occupied webs were present, spiders either invaded webs and evicted the owners, or settled adjacent to and attached their webs to those of residents. Various microhabitat variables (height, angle, temperature, humidity, and substrate character of the rock surface) of randomly selected unoccupied sites and the web sites chosen by spiders were compared. There were no detectable differences between web sites and unoccupied sites with respect to any of the variables measured. This leads us to conclude that web-site choice by immigrating spiders was based on the presence of silk rather than other features of the site.},

Historically, the stereotyped responses of larvae to light and odors captivated the attention of biologists. More recently, the sensory receptors responsible for chemosensation, thermosensation, and vision have been identified. While our understanding of the molecular logic of perception has clearly progressed, little is known about the neural and computational mechanisms guiding movement in sensory gradients. Here we review evidence that larvae orient based on active sensation — a feature distinct from the strategies used by simpler model organisms. Reorientation maneuvers are controlled by the spatiotemporal integration of changes in stimulus intensity detected during runs and lateral head movements.},

@article{sumpter_principles_2006,
	title = {The principles of collective animal behaviour},
	volume = {361},
	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

	shorttitle = {Is aggregated oviposition by the blow flies {Lucilia} sericata and {Phormia} regina ({Diptera}},
	abstract = {When female blow flies Lucilia sericata and Phormia regina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) oviposit in aggregations on carrion, even-aged larval offspring reportedly develop faster, and fewer are parasitized or preyed upon. The benefits of aggregated oviposition equally affect con- and heterospecific larvae sharing a resource. The benefits imply that female blow flies engage in coordinated, pheromone-mediated oviposition behavior. Yet, repeated attempts to identify oviposition pheromones have failed invoking doubt that they exist. Simply by regurgitating and feeding on carrion, flies may produce attractive semiochemicals. If flies were to aggregate in response to feeding flies rather than ovipositing flies, then the semiochemical cue(s) may be associated with the salivary gland. Working with L. sericata and P. regina and using liver as a surrogate oviposition medium, we test the hypotheses, and present data in their support, that (i) gravid or nongravid females ovipositing and/or feeding on liver enhance its attractiveness to gravid and nongravid females; (ii) females respond to semiochemicals from feeding heterospecific females; (iii) females respond equally well to semiochemicals from feeding con- and heterospecific females; (iv) macerated head tissues of females applied to liver enhance its attractiveness; and (v) females in direct contact with and feeding on liver, but not when next to yet physically separated from liver, enhance attraction of flies. We conclude that oviposition site-seeking females do not respond to an oviposition pheromone. Instead, they appear to coopt semiochemicals associated with feeding flies as resource indicators, taking chances that resources are suitable for oviposition, and that ovipositing flies are present.},

	abstract = {* Sociality has been shown to have adaptive value for gregarious species, with more socially integrated animals within groups experiencing higher reproductive success and longevity. The value of social integration is often suggested to derive from an improved ability to deal with social stress within a group; other potential stressors have received less attention.


* We investigated the relationship between environmental temperature, an important non-social stressor, and social integration in wild female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), using implanted data loggers to obtain direct measures of core body temperature.


* Heterothermy (as measured by 24-h amplitude of body temperature) increased, and 24-h minima of body temperature decreased, as the 24-h minimum ambient temperature decreased. As winter progressed, monkeys became increasingly heterothermic and displayed lower 24-h minima of body temperature.


* Monkeys with a greater number of social partners displayed a smaller 24-h amplitude (that is, were more homoeothermic) and higher 24-h minima of body temperature (that is, became less hypothermic), than did animals with fewer social partners.


* Our findings demonstrate that social integration has a direct influence on thermoregulatory ability: individual animals that form and maintain more social relationships within their group experience improved thermal competence compared to those with fewer social relationships.


* Given the likely energetic consequences of thermal benefits, our findings offer a viable physiological explanation that can help account for variations in fitness in relation to individual differences in social integration.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Many bioassays have shown that cuticular hydrocarbons are used in the recognition systems of both solitary and social insects. The function of insect recognition systems is to enable an insect to recognize, and possibly discriminate, its own species, sex, or kin from that of other insects. The primary function of cuticular hydrocarbons is to protect the insects from desiccation. Hydrocarbons can be removed from insect cuticles and characterized with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Studies using such analytical techniques have revealed that insect hydrocarbon compositions are species-specific, sex-specific and, in social insects, colony- and caste-specific. Furthermore, recognition bioassays have confirmed that certain components of the cuticle of some insect species are sex attractants as well as aphrodisiacs or sex inhibitors. Other bioassays have shown that hydrocarbons are important in facilitating colony structure in social insects. In addition, the hydrocarbons of some parasitic insects appear to mimic those of their host species. Thus, hydrocarbons are proving to be very important in the everyday activities of many insect species.},

Producers contemplating a mixed-species enterprise should reflect on several considerations before implementing this animal management strategy. Factors applicable to a particular producer's landscape must be considered together with goals and economic constraints before implementing mixed-species stocking. A major consideration when using mixed-species stocking is how to deal with predation losses, especially among small ruminants. An approach being adopted in some commercial operations capitalizes on using innate animal behaviors to form cohesive groups of two or more livestock species that consistently remain together under free-ranging conditions. These groups are referred to as flerds. The mixing of a flock of sheep and/or goats with a herd of cattle into a flerd has been shown to protect sheep and goats from coyote predation, as well as offering other husbandry advantages. Some of the added advantages include more efficient conversion of forage into animal protein. Creation of flerds, their maintenance and advantages are discussed.},

The egg-laying behaviour of Lucilia sericata was observed under controlled conditions on wet, artificially wounded or short-haired areas of rat cadavers. Flies laid significantly more eggs on the wet area and the area with short hair than on the dry area or area with long hair. No eggs were observed inside the wounds in any of the replicates.

The effect of egg immersion (body fluids often exudes in wounds) on the survival rate of larvae was also investigated. In low water condition, an average of 72.7 ± 7.9\% of the larvae survived and they reached a mean length of 7.5 ± 0.6 mm. In contrast, submerging eggs under a high volume of water strongly affected their survival rate (25 ± 3.7\%) and development. Similar results were observed using unfrozen pig blood instead of water.

These data question the information found in the literature regarding the preferential egg-laying behaviour of Calliphorids flies in wounds.},

Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions.

Females were more attracted than males to liver odour. The attraction of females lay in the ranges of 0-22\% for single compounds, 26-64\% for synthetic blends and 58-88\% for authentic odours. Dimethyl trisulphide was the most attractive single compound. Significant improvement in attraction was achieved with blends and a three-component lure, consisting of dimethyl trisulphide, mercaptoethanol and o-cresol, was found to be the best solution for field trapping of C. vicina. Authentic odours from dead fish and mice were significantly more attractive than liver and the three-component blend, and the blend and liver were similarly effective as attractants.

The transect with N. clavipes contained more spiders in general than that without N. clavipes, most of which were L. venusta for both transects. The height above ground of L. venusta webs associated with N. clavipes presented a larger range of distribution, which closely mimicked that of N. clavipes webs except when the N.clavipes web was at ground level. Leucauge venusta webs were more inclined when in association with N. clavipes (49.4 3.3 vs 20.4 2.0).

	abstract = {This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following Galton (1871) and Williams (1964) gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator.

It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others.

Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations.

The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value.},

	volume = {59},
	abstract = {Larvae of the necrophagous Blowfly Lucilia sericata (Diptera Calliphoridae) live on vertebrate cadavers. Although continuously feeding was previously assumed for this species, we hypothesized that larvae do not feed constantly. According to this hypothesis, their crop should not always be full, which should be reflected in crop surfaces. We dissected and measured the crops of larvae of the same age and bred in the same conditions. Crop surfaces of 117 larvae just removed from the food ranged from 0 to 16.6 mm2 (mean = 5.325 ± 2.84 mm2). The distribution of these crop surfaces indicates a continuous variation of satiation/feeding activity in the population. Starving experiments showed a quite long digestive process. After 90 min of starving, the decrease in crop surfaces became obvious, but 150 min were necessary to observe more than a half of the population with an empty crop (less than 2 mm2). No more differences were observed after 150, 180 and 240 min of starving. We finally used starved larvae to observe the kinetic of food absorption and the duration of the food-intake phase. Our results indicates that larvae can ingest faster than they digest. After 5 min spent in the food, 70\% of the larvae had a crop surface larger or equal to 8 mm2. We observed for the first time an over-feeding of the larvae, with high crop surfaces overrepresented compared to larvae never starved (control).

Together, these results indicate that larvae do not feed continuously, and regulate their foraging behavior. We propose that the foraging behavior of the larvae creates a permanent movement inside the larval masses. This turnover/scramble competition may be linked to the larval-mass effect, i.e. the local temperature increase observed in large necrophagous larvae aggregates.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the role of early social experience on the ontogeny of kin and nestmate recognition in ants by means of both behavioral and chemical analysis. Workers of two ant species,Manica rubida (Myrmicinae) andFormica selysi (Formicinae), were reared in homospecific groups (control) or in artificial heterospecific groups (mixed), created less than 5 h after their emergence. Recognition was evaluated between unfamiliar individuals of different species reared in control and mixed groups for periods of 5, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 8, 15, 30, 60, or 90 days after emergence. Heterospecifically reared individuals of both species gradually became tolerant of allospecific individuals from control groups. Moreover, homospecifically reared individuals did not aggress allospecific individuals reared in mixed groups. During the course of familiarization between the species, there were modifications of the chemical recognition signals. In mixed groups, hydrocarbon profiles of both species acquire gradually some of the components characteristic of their heterospecific nestmates. These experiments showed that allospecific recognition required the acquisition of a minimal quantity of allospecific cues. The phenomenon provided an another example of the relationship between tolerance and the chemical cues displayed by both species. The results suggested that the individual recognized the allospecific cues borne on each individual's body surface and/or that each individual learned and memorized allospecific cues during its early life. Therefore, each individual might develop a template encoding the allospecific and the conspecific cues to characterize nestmates.},

	abstract = {In einem Ökosystem beeinflussen sich Tiere gegenseitig in erster Linie durch direkte Interaktionen. Ihr Verhalten kann aber auch indirekt durch chemotaktile Stoffe die andere Tiere in der Umwelt hinterlassen beeinflusst werden. Vergleichbar zu direkten Interaktionen können indirekt ausgelöste Verhaltensänderungen einen starken Einfluss auf Populationsdynamiken und Gemeinschaftsstrukturen eines Ökosystems haben. Obwohl das daran gehegte Interesse der Ökologen in den letzten Jahrzenten stark gestiegen ist, fehlen immer noch Studien, welche über mehrere Arten hinweg versuchen die übergreifende Relevanz von chemotaktilen Stoffen herauszufinden. Im Rahmen meiner Doktorarbeit untersuchte ich daher wie sich mehrere mitteleuropäische Arthropodenarten, abhängig von deren interspezifischen Räuber-Beute- und Konkurrenzbeziehungen, mittels chemotaktiler Stoffe beeinflussen können. Mithilfe unterschiedlicher Verhaltensversuche konnte ich empirisch nachweisen, dass verschiedene Arthropoden chemotaktile Stoffe zu ihrem eigenen Vorteil nutzen können. Außerdem zeigen meine Ergebnisse, dass die Verhaltensänderungen artspezifisch und abhängig von den jeweiligen Lebenszyklen und den damit verbundenen Eigenschaften (z.B. Körpergröße, Häufigkeit oder Rangordnung) der beteiligten Arten sind. Ich vermute daher, dass Arthropoden chemotaktile Stoffe ihrer Gegenspieler wahrnehmen und interpretieren können. Eine Verhaltensänderung scheint jedoch nur dann statt zu finden wenn ein Nichtreagieren starke Fitnesskosten mit sich führen würde. Zusammenfassend zeigen die Ergebnisse meiner Doktorarbeit, wie wichtig es ist, die Bedeutung von chemotaktilen Stoffen innerhalb vieler Arten einer Gemeinschaft zu testen, um die den Verhaltensänderungen zugrundeliegenden Ursachen identifizieren zu können. Dies wiederum stellt die Grundlage, um die ökologische Relevanz von chemotaktilen Stoffen und deren mögliche Effekte auf Ökosystemfunktionen besser zu verstehen. 
Organisms that inhabit the same ecosystem can influence each other either via direct interactions but also indirectly by emitting chemotactile cues in the environment. Behavioral changes induced by chemotactile cues can alter population dynamics and community structures equally strong as direct interactions. Their interest to ecologists has therefore increased rapidly in recent years. However, studies including multiple species to enlighten the overarching relevance of chemotactile cues are still rare. In my doctoral thesis I therefore investigated behavioral responses to chemotactile cues within interspecific predator-prey and competitor-competitor relationships among multiple and syntopic Mid-European arthropod species. By using different behavioral approaches, I provide empirical evidence that chemotactile cues can be used by several arthropods in favor of their own benefit. Moreover, my results show that behavioral changes are species-specific and depend on the respective life-history traits like e.g. body size, commonness or dominance rank of the species involved. I therefore assume that arthropods can detect and interpret chemotactile cues of their opponents but only implement behavioral responses if they trade-off otherwise incurred fitness costs. In summary, the results of my doctoral thesis show that it is of great importance to investigate the role of chemotactile cues within multi-species communities for being able to identify the underlying causes inducing behavioral responses. This in turn represents the basis to better understand the ecological relevance of chemotactile cues and their potential effects on ecosystem functions.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Attraction to conspecifics may have wide‐ranging implications for habitat selection and metapopulation theory, yet little is known about the process of attraction and its effects relative to other habitat selection strategies. Using individual‐based simulations, I investigated the emergent properties of conspecific attraction during habitat selection on survival, fecundity, short‐term fitness (sur \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{vival\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{fecundity\}{\textbackslash},\$ ), and distributions in fragmented landscapes. I simulated conspecific attraction during searching and settlement decisions and compared attraction with random, habitat‐based (searching for the presence of habitat), and habitat quality sampling strategies (searching for and settling in high‐quality habitat). Conspecific attraction during searching or settlement decisions had different consequences for animals: attraction while searching increased survival by decreasing time spent in nonsuitable habitat, whereas attraction during settlement increased fecundity by aggregating animals in high‐quality habitats. Habitat‐based sampling did not improve fitness over attraction, but directly sampling habitat quality resulted in the highest short‐term fitness among strategies. These results suggest that attraction can improve fitness when animals cannot directly assess habitat quality. Interestingly, conspecific attraction influenced distributions by generating patch size effects and weak edge effects, highlighting that attraction is one potential, yet previously unappreciated, mechanism to explain the widespread patterns of animal sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.},

	abstract = {A reduction in individual vigilance with an increase in group size is one of the most frequently reported relationships in the study of animal behaviour. It has been argued that this phenomenon may not be a direct consequence of an increase in group size but may be due to other factors relating to increased group size, such as increased foraging competition. However, there is evidence for a direct relationship between group size and vigilance where other variables have been controlled. The aim of this review is to highlight the fact that the functional explanation of the group size effect remains unclear. Some authors have considered just one hypothesis, the group vigilance or ‘many eyes’ hypothesis. This states that, by taking advantage of the vigilance of other group members, individuals can reduce their own vigilance. However, there is an alternative, or additional, possibility that if individual vigilance declines with a reduction in individual predation risk, the group size effect could be accounted for by a reduction in individual risk at higher group sizes, as is widely thought to occur through encounter, dilution and confusion effects. In this review, it is shown that evidence previously interpreted in terms of one hypothesis may also be interpreted in terms of the other. Future research should be directed towards explicit consideration of the two effects and empirical tests to distinguish their relative importance. It is proposed that the individual risk hypothesis, with group vigilance as one element, provides a more general framework for understanding variation in vigilance behaviour with group size and with other factors.},

The relative spectral sensitivity of larvae of Calliphora vomitoria and C. erythrocephala has been determined, using the maggot's natural tendency to travel towards the weaker of two opposing lights.2. The response to light at each wavelength between 402 and 602 m\{micro\} was the same for the two species, within \{+/-\}0.1 log unit, and the results are well fitted by the bell-shaped curve characteristic of a (hypothetical) visual purple, maximal at 504 m\{micro\}.3. Reduction of the intensity of the white standard light by one log unit did not change the shape of the curve, and the extended wavelength range, between 362 and 640 m\{micro\}, shows no sign of a subsidiary maximum of sensitivity. The levels of illumination were 10-2 and 10-3 f.c., and the absolute threshold was found to be about 10-6 f.c.4. The spectral sensitivity found here is compared with the results of other workers for muscid flies and larvae. It is concluded that one of the independent maxima of sensitivity found in the flies is a continuance from the larval state.},

	abstract = {* 1Since parasite transmission is often density-dependent, group living is normally thought to lead to an increased exposure to parasitism. As a consequence, it is predicted that animals living in groups will invest more resources (energy, time, risk, etc.) in parasite defence than those living solitarily.
* 2We tested this prediction by measuring basal immune parameters in the larvae of 12 species of Lepidoptera, grouped into six phylogenetically matched species-pairs, each comprising one solitary feeding and one gregariously feeding species.
* 3Contrary to expectation, the solitary species in all six species-pairs had higher total haemocyte counts than the gregarious species, and in five out of six species-pairs the solitary species also exhibited higher phenoloxidase activity. Both measurements were positively correlated with each other and with the magnitude of the cellular encapsulation response.
* 4The relationship between infection risk and group living was investigated with a dynamic, spatially explicit, host–pathogen model. This shows that when individuals aggregate in groups, the per capita risk of infection can be reduced if the lower between-group transmission more than compensates for the higher within-group transmission.
* 5We conclude that the expectation that group living always leads to increased exposure to pathogens and parasites is overly simplistic, and that the specific details of the social system in question will determine if there is increased or decreased exposure to infection.},

Recordings were carried out at various temperatures using larvae of different developmental stages. As temperature increased, the larvae crawled at a faster speed. Furthermore, speed increased as a function of body length. We present a general allometric relationship to express the average crawling speed of larvae as a combined function of temperature and body length, expressed in the following equation: speed ( cm / min ) = 5.45 × log [ length ( mm ) ] + 0.66 × temperature ( ∘ C ) - 12.8 These results are particularly useful in forensic entomology for estimating the time that elapsed following the larva's departure from the corpse.

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Individuals of gregarious species that initiate collective movement require mechanisms of cohesion in order to maintain advantages of group living. One fundamental question in the study of collective movement is what individual rules are employed when making movement decisions. Previous studies have revealed that group movements often depend on social interactions among individual members and specifically that collective decisions to move often follow a quorum-like response. However, these studies either did not quantify the response function at the individual scale (but rather tested hypotheses based on group-level behaviours), or they used a single group size and did not demonstrate which social stimuli influence the individual decision-making process. One challenge in the study of collective movement has been to discriminate between a common response to an external stimulus and the synchronization of behaviours resulting from social interactions. Here we discriminate between these two mechanisms by triggering the departure of one trained Merino sheep (Ovis aries) from groups containing one, three, five and seven naïve individuals. Each individual was thus exposed to various combinations of already-departed and non-departed individuals, depending on its rank of departure. To investigate which individual mechanisms are involved in maintaining group cohesion under conditions of leadership, we quantified the temporal dynamic of response at the individual scale. We found that individuals' decisions to move do not follow a quorum response but rather follow a rule based on a double mimetic effect: attraction to already-departed individuals and attraction to non-departed individuals. This rule is shown to be in agreement with an adaptive strategy that is inherently scalable as a function of group size.},

The profound impact of human introduced invasive species on indigenous biota, and the facilitation of establishment as a result of changing thermal conditions, has been well documented on the French sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands (South Indian Ocean). The present study provides an overview of the vulnerability of sub-Antarctic terrestrial communities with respect to two interacting factors, namely climate change and alien insects. We present datasets assimilated by our teams on the Kerguelen Islands since 1974, coupled with a review of the literature, to evaluate the mechanism and impact of biological invasions in this region. First, we consider recent climatic trends of the Antarctic region, and its potential influence on the establishment, distribution and abundance of alien insects, using as examples one fly and one beetle species. Second, we consider to what extent limited gene pools may restrict alien species’ colonisations. Finally, we consider the vulnerability of native communities to aliens using the examples of one beetle, one fly, and five aphid species taking into consideration their additional impact as plant virus vectors. We conclude that the evidence assimilated from the sub-Antarctic islands can be applied to more complex temperate continental systems as well as further developing international guidelines to minimise the impact of alien species.},

Group-living animals can make such decisions by using their own personal information or by pooling information with other group members (i.e. social information). Here, we investigate how individuals might best balance their use of personal and social information. We use a simple modelling approach in which individual decisions based upon social information are more likely to be correct when more individuals are involved and their personal information is more accurate. Our model predicts that when the personal information of group members is poor (accurate less than half the time), individuals should avoid pooling information. In contrast, when personal information is reliable (accurate at least half the time), individuals should use personal information less often and social information more often, and this effect should grow stronger in larger groups. One implication of this pattern is that social information allows less well-informed members of large groups to reach a correct decision with the same probability as more well-informed members of small groups. Thus, animals in larger groups may be able to minimize the costs of collecting personal information without impairing their ability to make correct decisions.},

We here show that this diversity of decision systems corresponds to a single rule of decision making in collectives. We first obtained a decision rule based on Bayesian estimation that uses the information provided by the behaviors of the other individuals to improve the estimation of the structure of the world. We then tested this rule in decision experiments using zebrafish (Danio rerio), and in existing rich datasets of argentine ants (Linepithema humile) and sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), showing that a unified model across species can quantitatively explain the diversity of decision systems. Further, these results show that the different counting systems used by animals, including humans, can emerge from the common principle of using social information to make good decisions.},

	abstract = {Body temperature in insects is affected by interactions between environmental variables, behavioural choices and the physiological state of the animal. Insect larvae display a number of tactics for thermoregulation which allow their body temperatures to deviate several degrees from ambient. Thermoregulatory adaptations can reduce generation time and allow higher population growth rates. However, few investigations have examined thermoregulation of moulting larvae. This study measured whether moulting Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) larvae thermoregulate, and, if so, whether they thermoregulate similarly to feeding larvae. Body temperatures of moulting and feeding larvae were compared to their microhabitat temperatures. In three of four environments, feeding larvae were able to thermoregulate in such a way that their body temperature was higher than ambient at low ambient temperature, and lower than ambient at higher ambient temperature. However, moulting larvae appear not to thermoregulate because their body temperature did not differ from ambient in three of four environments. These results pose the question of whether larvae are behaviourally and/or physiologically constrained from thermoregulating during the moulting process. Additional studies are needed to address such questions and would help to elucidate the impact of thermoregulation of moulting larvae on the ecology and evolution of insects.},

	title = {{Mean} {crowding}},
	volume = {36},
	copyright = {Copyright © 1967 British Ecological Society},
	abstract = {Patchy distributions matter, from the point of view of the animals involved, because the individuals tend to find more others of their own kind right around them than would be the case in a random distribution. The animals are more 'crowded', in this sense, than their mean density would lead one to believe. For data from randomly placed quadrats, the proposed parameter 'mean crowding' ( \${\textbackslash}overset {\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}to\{m\}\$ ) attempts to measure this effect by defining the mean number per individual of other individuals in the same quadrat. 'Mean crowding' is algebraically identical with mean density, augmented by the amount the ratio of variance to mean exceeds unity, i.e. \${\textbackslash}overset {\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}to\{m\}=m+({\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}\{2\}/m)-1\$ . It can be viewed as equal to that increased mean density which a patchily distributed population could have, and be no more 'crowded' on the average than it is now, if it had a random distribution. The contention that populations with differing mean densities but the same 'mean crowding' would suffer the same density-dependent effects on mortality, natality, and dispersal implies the untested assumption that the effect of crowding on each individual varies linearly with the number of others around it, which are responsible for the crowding. Also implied is that each local situation (quadrat) is equally good habitat for the animals, has an equal rate of supply of expendable resources, and provides an equal amount of 'room', or cover, which the animals can use to avoid each other. If this assumption is perfectly fulfilled, however, then the patchy distribution itself becomes an ecological enigma: if the effects of crowding are more severe in the locally densest patches, then the local density should decrease more rapidly and increase more slowly there than elsewhere. The overall patchiness should decrease, in fact, until the distribution eventually comes to resemble a random one. Undoubtedly, a great deal of the patchines that one finds in continuous habitats can be explained in terms of local differences in habitat suitability. On the other hand, there is often a large component that appears to be utterly capricious. Since all of the capricious component should long since have been eroded away by density-dependent effects of crowding-if these are important-I must conclude that they are not important in such species, or, if they are, that other population processes (e.g. interactions with other species) regenerate patchiness as rapidly as it is destroyed. This fits in well with a general conviction that patchiness has a great deal more to do with undercrowding than with overcrowding, since 'mean crowding' often appears to be as great in rare species as it is in common ones (of comparable size). A suitable measure of patchiness is the ratio of 'mean crowding' to mean density. Where the distribution can be adequately approximated by the negative binomial, with parameters m and k, we have \${\textbackslash}overset {\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}to\{m\}/m=1+k{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . The sample estimate for 'mean crowding' is \${\textbackslash}overset {\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}to\{x\}={\textbackslash}overline\{x\}(1+{\textbackslash}hat\{k\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$ . Standard errors are given for the cases where k̂ is estimated by maximum likelihood, by moments, by the number of empty quadrats, and also for the truncated negative binomial. The idea is briefly extended to apply to 'mean crowding' between species and to 'subjective' species diversity, without attempting in these cases to develop standard errors. Most importantly, I have tried to specify the types of habitats and distributions to which the parameter 'mean crowding' is not intended to apply.},

	abstract = {Associative plasticity is a basic essential attribute of nervous systems. As shown by numerous reports, Drosophila is able to establish simple forms of appetitive and aversive olfactory associations at both larval and adult stages. Whereas most adult studies on aversive learning employed electric shock as a negative reinforcer, larval paradigms essentially utilized gustatory stimuli to create negative associations, a discrepancy that limits the comparison of data. To overcome this drawback, we critically revisited larval odor–electric shock conditioning. First, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl), which was used in all previous larval electric shock paradigms, is not required per se in larval odor–electric shock learning. This is of considerable practical advantage because beside its peculiar effects LiCl is attractive to larvae at low concentration that renders comparative learning studies on genetically manipulated larvae complicated. Second, we confirm that in both a 2-odor reciprocal and a 1-odor nonreciprocal conditioning regimen, larvae are able to associate an odor with electric shock. In the latter experiments, initial learning scores reach an asymptote after 5 training trials, and aversive memory is still detectable after 60 min. Our experiments provide a comprehensive basis for future comparisons of larval olfactory conditioning reinforced by different modalities, for studies aimed at analyzing odor–electric shock learning in the larva and the adult, and for investigations of the cellular and molecular substrate of aversive olfactory learning in the simple Drosophila model.},

	abstract = {Animals use sensory stimuli to assess and select habitats, mates, and food as well as to communicate with other individuals. One of the great mysteries of crustacean ecology is how postlarvae locate the relatively rare patches of coral reef habitat on which they settle. The present study aimed to estimate, by experiments in aquaria and biochemical analysis, the sensory modalities of crustacean postlarvae for senses used in searching for their species’ settlement habitat. The study was carried out on 9 crustacean species (Calappa calappa, Pachygrapsus planifrons, Xanthidae sp., Lysiosquillina maculata, L. sulcata, Raoulserenea sp., Stenopus hispidus, Palaemonidae sp., and Panulirus penicillatus). For each species, a cohort of 30 postlarvae was captured on the same night on the reef crest of Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia). Among the 9 crustacean species studied, 6 made active habitat choices among the 4 habitats tested (live coral, dead coral, macroalgae, and sand) at the postlarval stage, but the presence or absence of conspecifics on the habitat did not influence their selective choice. Sensory experiments found that 4 species differentiated between their preferred habitat versus another habitat and 2 species differentiated between conspecifics and heterospecifics, using visual and/or olfactory cues. Lastly, the high performance liquid chromatography experiments showed that the 4 habitats and conspecifics (except L. maculata and S. hispidus) tested have different and unique chemical odors. Overall, our study is the first to highlight the sensory modalities for a broad range of crustacean species to detect and move toward settlement habitats and/or conspecifics.},

This study investigates the relationship between maggot numbers in a mass and heat generation. Single-species aggregations (Lucilia sericata) of various sizes (50–2500 individuals) were reared in the laboratory at a constant ambient temperature of 22°C. Internal mass temperatures were recorded every 5 min throughout the feeding stage of development. Results showed that mass temperatures increased with mass numbers (p-value {\textless} 0.001), ranging from 2.5 to 14°C above ambient. A minimum mass size of 1200 produced overall temperatures that were significantly warmer than ambient, diverging away from 22°C after c. 26 h. These results indicate that the microclimate of a mass has the potential to differ significantly from ambient, which may be influencing larval development rates and should therefore be factored into mPMI estimates to increase accuracy.},

	abstract = {Mixed-species flocks of birds composed of chickadees, titmice, woodpeckers, nuthatches, creepers, kinglets, and wood warblers were studied in several habitats in Louisiana, Maryland, and Maine. Chickadees and titmice usually led these groups. Both the size of the flock and density of birds varied with the habitat. An inverse relation existed between the density of birds in a habitat and the percentage of them that were species participating in flocks. Individuals of species regularly participating in flocks sometimes were found away from them. The tendency for such an individual to be in a flock was inversely related to the density of birds in the habitat. Hostile interactions were infrequent in flocks, being mostly of an intraspecific nature. A dominance hierarchy existed between the different species in flocks. A definite distance was maintained between individuals. As flock size increased the area occupied per individual decreased. The larger flocks were, the faster they usually moved. Each species favored certain parts of the habitat when foraging, though overlap existed between almost all pairs of species. The commonest species (Chickadees, titmice, kinglets) overlapped heavily. Subordinate species foraging in the presence of dominant species changed their areas of foraging, but little or no tendency was seen for subordinates to affect the foraging of dominants. Subordinates might either spread out over alternative foraging areas or concentrate their activities more strongly in a few areas. Most flock members responded markedly to predators; however, few predators were observed during the study. Many of the responses seen were delivered to inappropriate stimuli. Several factors suggest a direct relationship between population density and food supply. Flocking appears to be an effective adaptation to difficult conditions. If a species adjusts its foraging in the presence of another species, possibilities of hostilities should be minimized. Subordinate species usually moved to parts of the habitat to which they were well-adapted. If dominant species are absent, however, opportunism by the subordinate may allow it to take advantage of otherwise unused resources. Dominants may obtain a more predictable portion of the food supply by participating in flocks that if solitary. Constant movement may insure that birds obtain the most readily available food. Large flocks may move rapidly because their individuals are more crowded than those in small flocks. With this restriction either increased speed or more concentrated foraging would be predicted. The low frequency of predators suggests that evasive responses of flock members may have been more advantageous than at present.},

A large diversity of species has developed kin recognition abilities, allowing individuals to discriminate conspecifics in relation to relatedness. In social insects, many studies showed that discrimination generally acts at the level of nestmateship and only few studies report kin recognition abilities. Our results highlight the importance of kin recognition in shaping social life in the urban cockroach Blattella germanica (L.) and present a complete description of the recognition system from expression to action components. Cockroaches of all developmental stages (nymphs and adults) discriminate siblings from nonsiblings independently of any prior social experience. Preference is context dependent so that siblings are preferred as social partners, whereas nonsiblings are preferred as mating partners. Discrimination is based on quantitative differences of cuticular hydrocarbons that are perceived through antennal contacts. As individual cuticular profiles remain stable over time, they constitute reliable discrimination cues correlated with relatedness. Our results offer interesting perspectives for the study of kin recognition and for the understanding of evolution toward sociality in insects.},

We identify a simple mechanism whereby a decision is taken on the move with limited information and signaling and without comparison of available opportunities.

	abstract = {A central concept in forensic entomology is that arthropod succession on carrion is predictable and can be used to estimate the postmortem interval (PMI) of human remains. However, most studies have reported significant variation in successional patterns, particularly among replicate carcasses, which has complicated estimates of PMIs. Several forensic entomology researchers have proposed that further integration of ecological and evolutionary theory in forensic entomology could help advance the application of succession data for producing PMI estimates. The purpose of this essay is to draw attention to the role of spatial aggregation of arthropods among carrion resources as a potentially important aspect to consider for understanding and predicting the assembly of arthropods on carrion over time. We review ecological literature related to spatial aggregation of arthropods among patchy and ephemeral resources, such as carrion, and when possible integrate these results with published forensic literature. We show that spatial aggregation of arthropods across resources is commonly reported and has been used to provide fundamental insight for understanding regional and local patterns of arthropod diversity and coexistence. Moreover, two suggestions are made for conducting future research. First, because intraspecific aggregation affects species frequency distributions across carcasses, data from replicate carcasses should not be combined, but rather statistically quantified to generate occurrence probabilities. Second, we identify a need for studies that tease apart the degree to which community assembly on carrion is spatially versus temporally structured, which will aid in developing mechanistic hypotheses on the ecological factors shaping community assembly on carcasses.},

	abstract = {In fragmented landscape, individuals have to cope with the fragmentation level in order to aggregate in the same patch and take advantage of group-living. Aggregation results from responses to environmental heterogeneities and/or positive influence of the presence of congeners. In this context, the fragmentation of resting sites highlights how individuals make a compromise between two individual preferences: (1) being aggregated with conspecifics and (2) having access to these resting sites. As in previous studies, when the carrying capacity of available resting sites is large enough to contain the entire group, a single aggregation site is collectively selected. In this study, we have uncoupled fragmentation and habitat loss: the population size and total surface of the resting sites are maintained at a constant value, an increase in fragmentation implies a decrease in the carrying capacity of each shelter. For our model organism, Blattella germanica, our experimental and theoretical approach shows that, for low fragmentation level, a single resting site is collectively selected. However, for higher level of fragmentation, individuals are randomly distributed between fragments and the total sheltered population decreases. In the latter case, social amplification process is not activated and consequently, consensual decision making cannot emerge and the distribution of individuals among sites is only driven by their individual propensity to find a site. This intimate relation between aggregation pattern and landscape patchiness described in our theoretical model is generic for several gregarious species. We expect that any group-living species showing the same structure of interactions should present the same type of dispersion-aggregation response to fragmentation regardless of their level of social complexity.},

	volume = {39},
	abstract = {Musca domestica larvae display in anterior and middle midgut contents, a proteolytic activity with pH optimum of 3.0–3.5 and kinetic properties like cathepsin D. Three cDNAs coding for preprocathepsin D-like proteinases (ppCAD 1, ppCAD 2, ppCAD 3) were cloned from a M. domestica midgut cDNA library. The coded protein sequences included the signal peptide, propeptide and mature enzyme that has all conserved catalytic and substrate binding residues found in bovine lysosomal cathepsin D. Nevertheless, ppCAD 2 and ppCAD 3 lack the characteristic proline loop and glycosylation sites. A comparison among the sequences of cathepsin D-like enzymes from some vertebrates and those found in M. domestica and in the genomes of Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum, and Bombyx mori showed that only flies have enzymes lacking the proline loop (as defined by the motif: DxPxPx(G/A)P), thus resembling vertebrate pepsin. ppCAD 3 should correspond to the digestive cathepsin D-like proteinase (CAD) found in enzyme assays because: (1) it seems to be the most expressed CAD, based on the frequency of ESTs found. (2) The mRNA for CAD 3 is expressed only in the anterior and proximal middle midgut. (3) Recombinant procathepsin D-like proteinase (pCAD 3), after auto-activation has a pH optimum of 2.5–3.0 that is close to the luminal pH of M. domestica midgut. (4) Immunoblots of proteins from different tissues revealed with anti-pCAD 3 serum were positive only in samples of anterior and middle midgut tissue and contents. (5) CAD 3 is localized with immunogold inside secretory vesicles and around microvilli in anterior and middle midgut cells. The data support the view that on adapting to deal with a bacteria-rich food in an acid midgut region, M. domestica digestive CAD resulted from the same archetypical gene as the intracellular cathepsin D, paralleling what happened with vertebrates. The lack of the proline loop may be somehow associated with the extracellular role of both pepsin and digestive CAD 3.},

	abstract = {This study suggests that alkaloid deficiency inUtetheisa (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) is a main cause of cannibalism; moreover, cannibalism can be predicted on the basis of alkaloid deficiency and of systemic alkaloid accumulation. This chemical plays a central role in the life of this species, because, first, it provides acquired chemical protection from potential predators, and, second, it determines mating success (as the alkaloid is an essential precursor of the male pheromone). Consequently, losers in the larval sequestering of alkaloids, which would result in a lack of chemical protection and in decreased mating success, tend to target conspecific winners, which are normally substantially protected against a variety of predators; by cannibalizing those accumulated alkaloid sources the losers tend to become the winners of cannibalistic encounters while making up their shortfall of these chemicals. What is a presumptive advantage in selection under high predation pressures and/or high alkaloid availabilities could become a disadvantage under high conspecific population densities and shortages of alkaloid supplies for larval uptake. Cannibalism may be expected to have general ecological importance in the evolutionary play ofUtetheisa and may contribute to a balanced regulation of the acquired alkaloid contents in these arctiid populations.},

	abstract = {Background \& objectives: The treatment of wounds with live green bottle fly larvae is receiving considerable attention in many countries. Laboratory rearing of Lucilia sericata is crucially important for the treatment of
wounds.
Study design: The study was carried out for mass rearing of green bottle flies from April to November 2010.
Hand catch and net trap baited with beef and cattle liver were used to collect adult flies from the field. The
collected samples were placed in appropriately labeled tubes and sent to the laboratory. Adult stage flies reared
in the insectary were used for species identification using specific keys.
Results: A total of 89 flies (55 females and 34 males) were collected from Hashtgerd area. In the first generation,
299 flies were produced in the laboratory including 105 (35.12\%) males, and 194 (64.88\%) females. The female/
male sex ratio was 1.61 for parents, whereas it was 1.84, 1.30 for F1 and F2 generations respectively. In total,
432 flies were reared in F3 generation including 173 (40.04\%) males, and 259 (59.96\%) females, and the sex
ratio was 1.49.
Conclusion: Setting up the mass rearing of sheep blowfly at the School of Public Health, Tehran University of
Medical Sciences is an important step in producing candidate flies for the treatment of myiasis by maggot therapy in future.},

	abstract = {Most physiological and ecological approaches to animal locomotion are based on steady state assumptions, yet movements of many animals are interspersed with pauses lasting from milliseconds to minutes. Thus, pauses, along with changes in the duration and speed of moves, form part of a dynamic system of intermittent locomotion by which animals adjust their locomotor behavior to changing circumstances. Intermittent locomotion occurs in a wide array of organisms from protozoans to mammals. It is found in aerial, aquatic and terrestrial locomotion and in many behavioral contexts including search and pursuit of prey, mate search, escape from predators, habitat assessment and general travel. In our survey, animals exhibiting intermittent locomotion paused on average nearly 50\% of their locomotion time (range 6–94\%). Although intermittent locomotion is usually expected to increase energetic costs as a result of additional expenditure for acceleration and deceleration, a variety of energetic benefits can arise when forward movement continues during pauses. Endurance also can be improved by partial recovery from fatigue during pauses. Perceptual benefits can arise because pauses increase the capacity of the sensory systems to detect relevant stimuli. Several processes, including velocity blur, relative motion detection, foveation, attention and interference between sensory systems are probably involved. In animals that do not pause, alternative mechanisms for stabilizing the perceptual field are often present. Because movement is an important cue for stimulus detection, pauses can also reduce unwanted detection by an organism's predators or prey. Several models have attempted to integrate energetic and perceptual processes, but many challenges remain. Future advances will require improved quantification of the effects of speed on perception.},

In the absence of choice, C. megacephala readily oviposited on fish that had been salted to levels of up to 40\% dry weight basis (dwb). Trials investigating the effects of feeding medium salt concentration on larval growth and mortality indicated that a high salt concentration of about 40\% (dwb) is necessary to effectively control infestation of salted fish by C. megacephala.

	abstract = {A study was conducted on decomposition and insect succession in the Prairie Ecozone of Saskatchewan in the year 2000. Eighteen domestic pig carcasses (42-79 kg) were employed as human models for applications to future homicide investigations in this region. Two major variables were considered including the effect of season and habitat (sun versus shade). Research was conducted over 25 weeks, spanning three seasons: spring, summer and fall. Ambient temperature, internal carcass temperature, faunistic succession over time, and the rate of decay were all compared for each experimental variable. Results indicated that habitat was only a factor in the decompositional rate of carrion in the spring season. The ambient temperature was the chief factor determining the seasonal variations in decay rate. Maximum internal carcass temperatures always coincided with the presence of 3rd instar larvae. Patterns of insect succession occurred in a predictable sequence that varied across different habitats and seasons and was unique compared to previously published studies. Carcasses placed in spring and fall attracted a more diverse assemblage of insects than summer-placed carrion. Sun-exposed carrion also had greater variation in fauna than shaded carrion in spring and fall. Members of Silphidae were the first coleopteran colonizers in all habitats and seasons. This paper also marks the first record for Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) in Saskatchewan.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Many organisms, from bacteria to human hunter-gatherers, use specialized random walk strategies to explore their environment. Such behaviors are an efficient stratagem for sampling the environment and usually consist of an alternation between straight runs and turns that redirect these runs. Drosophila larvae execute an exploratory routine of this kind that consists of sequences of straight crawls, pauses, turns, and redirected crawls. Central pattern generating networks underlying rhythmic movements are distributed along the anteroposterior axis of the nervous system. The way in which the operation of these networks is incorporated into extended behavioral routines such as substrate exploration has not yet been explored. In particular, the part played by the brain in dictating the sequence of movements required is unknown.
Results
We report the use of a genetic method to block synaptic activity acutely in the brain and subesophageal ganglia (SOG) of larvae during active exploratory behavior. We show that the brain and SOG are not required for the normal performance of an exploratory routine. Alternation between crawls and turns is an intrinsic property of the abdominal and/or thoracic networks. The brain modifies this autonomous routine during goal-directed movements such as those of chemotaxis. Nonetheless, light avoidance behavior can be mediated in the absence of brain activity solely by the sensorimotor system of the abdomen and thorax.
Conclusions
The sequence of movements for substrate exploration is an autonomous capacity of the thoracic and abdominal nervous system. The brain modulates this exploratory routine in response to environmental cues.},

	abstract = {In Europe larvae of blowflies are the main group of insects responsible for decomposition of exposed vertebrate remains, including the human body. This determines their high forensic importance and frequent application for estimation of PMI. The importance of proper identification of insects collected in forensic cases and experiments to the species level is underlined by all manuals of forensic entomology (e.g. Smith 1986; Byrd and Castner 2001; Greenberg and Kunich 2002). Especially difficult is the identification of the larval stages, where breeding to the adult stage or DNA-based methods are recommended. Fortunately, the available knowledge of the morphology of third instars of Calliphoridae is sufficiently good to allow the preparation of a complete identification key for at least all European species of forensic importance. Eleven species are included in the key. Most of them are widespread through Europe (Rognes 2004) and have been frequently reported from both real cases and carrion experiments, and the necessity of their inclusion into the key cannot be questioned. There are: Calliphora vicina, C. vomitoria, Chrysomya albiceps, Phormia regina, Protophormia terraenovae, Lucilia caesar, L. illustris, L. sericata. The author has also decided to add three additional species to the key: Cynomya mortuorum, Chrysomya megacephala, and Lucilia ampullacea. Recently, the larvae of Cynomya mortuorum were recorded from human corpses at least twice (Stærkeby 2001; Benecke 2002). Smith (1986) points out this species as rather a late newcomer in comparison to other blowflies, but recent research on succession shows that in spring conditions Cynomya mortuorum may be among the first colonizers of pig carrion (Szpila et al. 2008).},

Many published studies vary in results, source populations, and experimental designs. Accordingly, disentangling genetic causes of developmental variation from environmental causes is difficult. This study determined the minimum time of development and pupal sizes of three populations of Lucilia sericata Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae; from California, Michigan, and West Virginia) at two temperatures (20°C and 33.5°C). Development times differed significantly between strain and temperature. In addition, California pupae were the largest and fastest developing at 20°C, but at 33.5°C, though they still maintained their rank in size among the three populations, they were the slowest to develop. These results indicate a need to account for genetic differences in development, and genetic variation in environmental responses, when estimating a postmortem interval with entomological data.},

	abstract = {Vectors of aggregation are well known for some arthropod species, but not for many others. We aimed to describe larval aggregation (experiment 1) in the carrion fly, Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and to investigate the effect of food and conspecifics on larval behaviour (experiment 2). In experiment 1, 40 larvae were placed in a petri dish with a homogeneous diet for 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h or 24 h. This experiment demonstrated for the first time under controlled conditions the active aggregation of L. sericata larvae. The results indicate that the aggregation took place quickly and was reinforced with time. After only 3 h, one main aggregate comprising a majority of individuals was observed. These results also highlight the likely use by necrophagous larvae of a signal left by conspecifics as an aggregation vector. In experiment 2, we used a video-tracking system to investigate whether such an aggregative signal exists. Fed and starved larvae were tracked for 5 min in a circular area with each half marked with a different signal combination. The time spent in the signal zones, the distance travelled, the velocity, the time at the stop and the number of stops in each zone were measured. The larvae were significantly retained by a signal (mark) left by conspecifics. Together, the results of this study demonstrate the existence of a contact and/or odour-mediated signal involved in the aggregative behaviour of necrophagous larvae.},

Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91 576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.},

* 3When yeast was added to the blood agar diet at 50 gp{\textgreater}1, both peak and final larval weights were increased by 25–50\% at higher larval densities (2–8 larvae/g diet) and the hatchling-adult development period was reduced by about 3 days.
* 4No adult insects emerged on an agar-yeast diet without blood. Increasing the concentration of blood from 10\% to 20\% increased adult weight at emergence by 50\%, though developmental period was not significantly affected.
* 5Increasing larval density significantly reduced the weights of pupae and emergent adults (by up to 50\%), both on the blood-agar-yeast diet and the lamb meat control. Percentage survival fell from 80–90\% to below 10\% on the blood-agar-yeast diet at the highest densities of 4 or 8 larvae/g diet, though survival on lamb was not significantly affected by density.},

These nutritional strategies profoundly affect the physiology, behaviour and performance of individuals, which in turn impact their social interactions within groups and societies. Here, we present a conceptual framework to study the role of nutrition as a major ecological factor influencing the development and maintenance of social life. We first illustrate some of the mechanisms by which nutritional differences among individuals mediate social interactions in a broad range of species and ecological contexts. We then explain how studying individual- and collective-level nutrition in a common conceptual framework derived from Nutritional Geometry can bring new fundamental insights into the mechanisms and evolution of social interactions, using a combination of simulation models and manipulative experiments.},

Oriented flight increased significantly from 36\% towards fresh carcasses to 68\%, 61\% and 65\% towards carcasses aged 3 days, 6 days and 9 days, respectively. Carcasses aged 20 days and 33 days were significantly less attractive, achieving 51\% and 41\% attraction, respectively. No differences emerged between the sexes in oriented flight, but a significant increase in female landings at the most attractive carcasses was observed. Headspace collections from the different stages of decay showed a succession in the volatile profile emitted from the carcasses and identified nine chemicals which peak in quantity in concurrence with the most attractive stages of decay. Three of these chemicals also showed dose-response effects as indicated by a significant correlation between the amount present and the proportion of flies responding. Blow flies are important pests and efficient traps are needed. The significant interaction between fly sex and carcass age highlights behavioural differences between male and female blow flies which can be exploited in blow fly trapping. Three new volatile chemicals, butylated hydroxyl toluene, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone and nonanal, emitted from dead mice are suggested as potential attractants.},

The study, performed in South-West France during summer, gives preliminary results in outdoor experimental conditions. The shape of the dispersal is circular and has a concentric distribution around the feeding zone. Puparia were most often found in a radius of 15 cm and circular statistical analysis showed that no preferential direction was taken by the larvae. The maximum distribution density was related to the feeding zone and the location of the oviposition site can be extrapolated.},

This assumption, and subsequent models relying on it, were based on empirical data on primitively eusocial wasps (Polistes dominulus). By reanalysing some of the experimental data that was previously thought to be irrelevant, we show that it is impossible to distinguish this assumption from a competing assumption based on preexisting differences among individuals. We propose experiments to help discriminate between the two assumptions and their corresponding models—the self-organization model and the correlational model. We urge other researchers to be cautious when interpreting their dominance data with the ’self-organization mindset’; in particular, ‘winner and loser effects’, which are often considered to give support to the self-organization assumption, are equally consistent with the correlational assumption.},

	abstract = {Abstract: During habitat selection, the presence of conspecifics can frequently drive a nonuniform distribution of animals across habitats of equivalent quality. In group‐living species, subgroups of individuals might display mutual attraction while differing in their preferences for environmental resources. The final decision to settle requires individuals to integrate both environmental and social cues. This raises the question of the relative importance of sociality and resources preferences in determining habitat choice. In this study, we examined the interactive influence of conspecific attraction on individual resource preferences on refuge choice in groups of cockroaches. Shelters scaled to the sizes of nymphs and adult males were offered to groups of only nymphs and only males and to mixed groups. The choices of males were consistent across social conditions. Conversely, the preferences of nymphs shifted depending on the social context; the presence of males overrode the affinity nymphs had for scaled‐size shelters. We developed a numerical model implementing parameters derived from these experiments to test whether the final spatial distribution of individuals originated from a differential attraction between nymphs and males that was associated with their relative body size. Finally, we propose a general framework for understanding how similar mechanisms can promote the skewed distribution of organisms at different spatial scales.},

Infrared imaging determined the temperatures within a mass and in the vicinity of the constituent individual larvae, whose movements were tracked by dyeing their tissues red. Individual Chrysomya rufifacies larvae selected temperatures above 27°C, significantly higher than the temperature selected by Calliphora vicina larvae (24.5°C). However, this same difference was not seen within a mass, with both species selecting temperatures around 28°C. Larval movement in a mass was nonrandom, indicating that larvae actively select their position in a mass. Furthermore, larvae have a strong tendency to select the hottest part of a mass; therefore, maximum mass temperatures might provide a reliable proxy for the actual temperatures experienced by larvae.},

This was investigated in two species of ladybird predators of aphids, Harmonia axyridis and Propylea japonica. H. axyridis is known to be the stronger intraguild predator and P. japonica to be the more frequent intraguild prey in interactions of these two species. These ladybirds share aphid prey on mugworts, hibiscus, and Italian ryegrasses in fields of northern Japan but largely avoid each other on the same plant. Fecal cues of these ladybird predators were found to contribute in their assessment of predation risk from conspecific and heterospecific competitors in common habitats. Gravid females of H. axyridis reduced rates of feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of conspecifics, but not when exposed to feces of P. japonica. In contrast, gravid females of P. japonica reduced feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of both H. axyridis and its own species. Females of both ladybird species exhibited similar behavior in response to water extracts of feces. For P. japonica, the influence of heterospecific feces was greater than that of conspecific feces. Our results demonstrate that feces of ladybirds contain odors that have the potential to deter the feeding and oviposition activities of conspecific as well as heterospecific ladybirds. Such deterrence allows these insects to avoid predation risk. Differences in responses of the two predators are discussed.},

Forensic entomology derives the bulk of its evidence from two sources: the ecological succession of carrion insect communities and the development of immature insects (Byrd and Castner 2001; Catts and Haskel 1990; Smith 1986). This chapter is concerned with assessing the confidence that can be placed in the accuracy of estimates derived from insect development.

Here, we investigated the effects in changes in small mammal density on species richness, abundance and prevalence of ectoparasitic fleas. The comparative analyses were conducted for different small mammal species and among several populations during a long-term survey. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in host density should be linked with an increase in parasite species richness both among host species and among populations within host species, as predicted by epidemiological models. We also used host species density data from literature. We found that host density has a major influence on the species richness of ectoparasite communities of small mammals among host populations. We found no relationship between data of host density from the literature and parasite species richness. In contrast with epidemiological hypotheses, we found no relationships between abundance, or prevalence, and host density, either among host species or among host populations. Moreover, a decrease in abundance of fleas in relation with an increase in host density was observed for two mammal species (Apodemus agrarius and A. flavicollis). The decrease or the lack of increase in flea abundance in relation with an increase in host density suggests anti-parasitic behavioural activities such as grooming.},

Our experimental studies in Fennoscandia and North America have shown that density and species richness of migrant birds breeding in the forests respond positively to experimentally augmented titmice densities. We used analytical modeling to analyze ecological conditions, which may favor a habitat selection process where later arriving individuals (colonists) use the presence of earlier established species (residents) as a cue to profitable breeding sites. We compared the fitness of two colonist strategies: colonists could either directly sample the relative quality of the patches (termed samplers) or, alternatively, they could also use residents as a cue of patch quality (cue-users). Model results suggested that cue-using strategy is more beneficial in most ecological conditions and that this may result in heterospecific attraction. Further field experiments showed that migrant individuals selected nest sites at close vicinity of nesting titmice, and bred earlier and reproduced better. We conclude that heterospecific attraction may be a common and widespread process among forest birds particularly in seasonal environments.},

Until now, no clear experimental demonstration was available about aggregation resulting from inter-attraction between conspecifics.

We present the dynamics of aggregation, not previously described in detail in literature, as being independent of the experimental conditions: homogeneous and heterogeneous environments with identical or different shelters. Indeed whatever these conditions, the aggregation is very quick. In less than 10 minutes more than 50\% of woodlice were aggregated in several small groups in the homogeneous environment or under shelters in the heterogeneous environment. After this fast aggregation, woodlice progressively moved into a single aggregate or under one shelter.

Here we show for the first time that aggregation in woodlice implies a strong social component and results from a trade-off between individual preferences and inter-attraction between individuals. Moreover, our results reveal that the response to the heterogeneities affects only the location of the aggregates and not the level of aggregation, and demonstrate the strong inter-attraction between conspecifics which can outweigh individual preferences. This inter-attraction can lead to situations that could seem sub-optimal.},

In this review, we present an update on progress in understanding taste perception in the model fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. An introduction to the fly’s taste system will be presented first, followed by a description of relevant behavioral assays developed to quantify taste perception at the organismal level and a short overview of electrophysiological studies performed on taste cells. The focal point will be the recent molecular-genetic investigations of the gustatory receptor (Gr) genes, which is complemented by a comparison between Drosophila and mammalian taste perception and transduction. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of Drosophila taste research, including three specific proposals that seem uniquely applicable to this exquisite model system and cannot, at least currently, be pursued elsewhere.},

For example, multicellularity and insect societies evolved independently multiple times. Several factors that confer evolutionary advantages on higher levels of organization have been proposed. In this paper we highlight one additional factor: the sharing of information between individuals. Information sharing is not subject to the intrinsic conservation laws that characterize the sharing of physical resources. A simple model will illustrate how information sharing can result in aggregates in which the individuals both receive more information about their environment and pay less for it. This may have played a role in the evolution of higher levels of organization.},

This layer consists of free lipids, a class of compounds that includes hydrocarbons, alcohols, fatty acids, waxes, acylglycerides, phospholipids and glycolipids (Gibbs and Crockett 1998), although the presence of the last three groups may reflect aggressive extraction techniques which remove both internal as well as external lipids. This waxy layer prevents desiccation and penetration of micro-organisms (Gullan and Cranston 1994) as well as encoding various chemical signals. In the majority of the insects, and nearly all social insects so far studied, the free lipids are dominated by hydrocarbons (Lockey 1988). Cuticular hydrocarbons are found in all life stages of insects and are biologically very stable. Their biosynthesis is genetically based and modulated by factors such as reproductive status (Monnin 2006), developmental stage (Martin et al. 2001), diet (Buczkowski et al. 2005) or temperature (Toolson 1982; Savarit and Ferveur 2002; Rouault et al. 2004). The link found between diet and hydrocarbon production in social insects by Liang and Silverman (2000, 2001) is disputable, since behavioural changes occur in {\textless}2 min suggesting direct hydrocarbon transfer via contact with the prey rather than via diet, which explains why the host acquires the entire cuticular hydrocarbon profile of the prey (Liang and Silverman 2000).},

	abstract = {Invasive species' facilitation, or benefiting, of native species is rarely considered in biological invasion literature but could have serious economic consequences should a non-native herbivore facilitate injury by a native pest of high-value crops. Japanese beetle (JB), Popillia japonica, a polyphagous scarab, facilitates feeding by the obligate fruit-feeding native green June beetle (GJB), Cotinis nitida, by biting into intact grape berries that GJB, which has blunt spatulate mandibles, is otherwise unable to exploit. Here, we show JB further facilitates GJB by contaminating fruits with yeasts, and by creating infection courts for yeasts associated with GJB, that elicit volatiles exploited as aggregation kairomones by GJB. Traps baited with combinations of grapes and beetles were used to show that fruits injured by JB alone, or in combination with GJB, become highly attractive to both sexes of GJB. Such grapes emit high amounts of fermentation compounds compared with intact grapes. Beetle feeding on grape mash induced the same volatiles as addition of winemaker's yeast, and similar attraction of GJB in the field. Eight yeast species were isolated and identified from JB collected from grapevine foliage. Establishment and spread of JB throughout fruit-growing regions of the United States is likely to elevate the pest status of GJB and other pests of ripening fruits in vineyards and orchards.},

	title = {Dynamics of {Aggregation} and {Emergence} of {Cooperation}},
	volume = {202},
	abstract = {Aggregation is one of the most basic social phenomena, and many activities of social insects are linked to it. For instance, the selection of a valuable site and the spatial organization of the population are very often by-products of amplifications based on the local density of nestmates. The patterns of aggregation are very diverse, ranging from the gathering of all animals in a unique site to their splitting between several ones. One might question how these multiple patterns emerge. Do ants actively initiate the formation of such patterns by modulating the emission of an attracting signal such as the trail pheromone? Alternatively, do patterns result from quantitative changes in the duration of interaction between animals once they have reached the gathering site, without any active modulation of the communications? To discuss these questions, we present two empirical studies: the gregarious behavior of cockroaches (Blatella) and self-assembly in the weaver ant (Oecophylla). Through experimental and theoretical studies, we show how a single behavior--the resting time--leads to a collective choice in both species. This behavior is a response to the density of conspecifics and can also be modulated by heterogeneities in the environment. In weaver ants, it allows the colony to focus the formation of chains in a given area among several potential sites. In cockroaches, it allows the gathering of individuals in particular shelters, depending on the proximity between strains. These results are discussed with emphasis on the role of aggregation processes in the emergence of cooperativity and task allocation.},

	abstract = {Collective fleeing is a complex process resulting from a network of environmental stimuli and interindividual interactions. Studies on fleeing behaviour have focused on the information spread initiated by a few stimulated individuals. Our goal was to link individuals' responses to the collective fleeing dynamics for gregarious insects simultaneously exposed to a stimulus. We found that an information cascade process occurs in groups of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, simultaneously exposed to a light stimulus. Moreover, the global fleeing pattern depended on group size. The steps of the response (reacting to the stimulus, finding an opening and leaving the shelter) differed in their sensitivity to group size. First, immobile individuals inhibited the fleeing response, while moving individuals amplified it. Second, once individuals had reacted, they reached an opening and stopped. Their low probability per unit time of finding this opening was constant regardless of group size or the mobility level of group members. Finally, the individual probability of leaving the shelter increased with the number of moving individuals still inside. We integrated the different behavioural steps, analysed independently, into a stochastic model. The results based on this model are in agreement with our experimental observations. This model constitutes a template that enables the exploration of the influence of environmental and social factors at work in other species and situations.},

	abstract = {This study presents differences in rate of decomposition and insect succession between exposed carcasses on the soil surface and those enclosed within a vehicle following carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Nine 45-kg pigs were used as models for human decomposition. Six animals were sacrificed by CO gas, half of which were placed within the driver’s side of separate enclosed vehicles and half were placed under scavenger-proof cages on the soil surface. A further three animals were sacrificed by captive headbolt and placed under scavenger proof cages on the soil surface. The pattern of insect succession and rate of decomposition were similar between surface carcasses within trials regardless of the mode of death. Progression through the physical stages of decomposition was 3–4 days faster in the enclosed vehicle due to higher temperatures there compared to external ambient temperatures. Patterns of insect succession also differed between the vehicle and surface treatments. Carcass attendance by representatives of the Calliphoridae was delayed within the vehicle environment by 16–18 h, while oviposition was not observed until 24–28 h following death. In contrast, attendance by Calliphoridae at surface carcasses occurred within 1 h of death, and oviposition occurred within 6–8 h of death. Typical patterns of insect succession on the carcasses were also altered. Carcass attendance by representatives of the Coleoptera occurred during the bloat stage of decomposition at surface carcasses but was delayed until the onset of wet decomposition (as defined by carcass deflation and breakage of the skin) within the vehicle environment. This study provides baseline data outlining the decomposition patterns of a carcass enclosed within a vehicle following CO poisoning in Western Australia. Understanding how variations in decomposition situations impact on the rate of decomposition and patterns of insect succession is essential to obtaining an accurate estimate of minimum post-mortem interval (PMI).},

However, while many animals live and make decisions within social groups, it is not well understood how associative learning functions within a social context. We describe an empirically derived model of collective learning and compare the learned performance of animals within groups to the optimal behavior for a wide range of environmental conditions and group sizes. We find that the learning rules derived from experiments with individual animals readily generalize to a social context, and these relatively simple rules result in behavior that is close to optimal, even when individuals know neither the size of their group nor the properties of environmental cues. Individuals that learn in isolation and subsequently join together as a group make substantially worse decisions. These results demonstrate the importance of learning within a collective context and highlight the need for experimental work to investigate the role of collective learning in enhancing decision accuracy in animal groups.},

	abstract = {Aggregation is a well documented behaviour in a number of animal groups. The “confusion effect” is one mechanism thought to mitigate the success of predators feeding on gregarious prey and hence favour aggregation. An artificial neural network model of prey targeting is developed to explore the advantages prey species might derive through a tendency to group. The network illustrates how an abstract model of the computational mechanisms mediating the perception of prey position is able to show a degradation in performance as group size increases. The relationship between group size and predator confusion has a characteristic decreasing decelerating shape. Prey “oddity” is shown to reduce the impact of the confusion effect, thereby allowing predators to target prey more accurately. Hence shoaling behaviour is most profitable to the prey when prey phenotypes are visually indistinguishable to a predator. Futhermore it is shown that prey “oddity” is relatively more costly in large groups than in small groups and the implications for assortative schooling are discussed. Both the model and the results are intended to make the general point that cognitive constraints will limit the information that a nervous system can process at a number of different levels of neural organization.},

	abstract = {Direct animal behavior can be inferred from the fossil record only in exceptional circumstances. The exceptional mode of preservation of ammonoid shells in the Posidonia Shale (Lower Jurassic, lower Toarcian) of Dotternhausen in southern Germany, with only the organic periostracum preserved, provides an excellent opportunity to observe the contents of the ammonoid body chamber because this periostracum is translucent. Here, we report upon three delicate lobsters preserved within a compressed ammonoid specimen of Harpoceras falciferum. We attempt to explain this gregarious behavior. The three lobsters were studied using standard microscopy under low angle light. The lobsters belong to the extinct family of the Eryonidae; further identification was not possible. The organic material of the three small lobsters is preserved more than halfway into the ammonoid body chamber. The lobsters are closely spaced and are positioned with their tails oriented toward each other. The specimens are interpreted to represent corpses rather than molts. The lobsters probably sought shelter in preparation for molting or against predators such as fish that were present in Dotternhausen. Alternatively, the soft tissue of the ammonoid may have been a source of food that attracted the lobsters, or it may have served as a long-term residency for the lobsters (inquilinism). The lobsters represent the oldest known example of gregariousness amongst lobsters and decapods in the fossil record. Gregarious behavior in lobsters, also known for extant lobsters, thus developed earlier in earth's history than previously known. Moreover, this is one of the oldest known examples of decapod crustaceans preserved within cephalopod shells.},

Feeding rates of HA larvae are significantly lower than those of LA larvae during the flexible period of growth which precedes attainment of critical mass for pupation. Consequently the HA larvae have a slower mean rate of development. In the fixed postcritical period of development the feeding rates of HA larvae are significantly higher than those of LA larvae. This causes a greater postcritical growth increment and larger adult flies. HA and LA larvae respond adaptively by changing the expression of components of their foraging behaviour depending on whether they are in or out of food. LA larvae exhibit a more flexible pattern of response and are also more successful competitors when food resources are limiting.},

	abstract = {Larval therapy, the therapeutic use of blowfly larvae to treat chronic wounds, is primarily used in debridement. There are, however, gaps in current knowledge of the optimal clinical application of the therapy and mechanisms of action in the debridement process. Using an artificial assay, two studies were undertaken to investigate these aspects of larval debridement by Lucilia sericata Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae); the first studied the effects of the density of larvae on tissue digestion and larval mass, and the second considered the effects on the same parameters of incorporating protease inhibitors into the feeding substrate. The total mass of tissue digested increased with larval density until saturation was observed at 5.0–7.5 larvae/cm2. This range was considered optimal as lower doses resulted in the removal of less tissue and higher doses offered no additional tissue removal and appeared to exacerbate competition for feeding. In the second study, increased protease inhibitor concentration led to significant decreases in tissue digestion and larval mass, suggesting that serine proteases, particularly trypsin, may play major roles in larval digestion. Such information is important in elucidating the main constituents that make up larval digestive products and may be significant in the development of new therapies.},

Some behavioral aspects relating to the host location process were investigated in the laboratory in order to improve the chance of success in possible biological control programmes. The searching behavior of the female parasitoid was examined in an open arena in order to evaluate the role of larval trails or rotten-fruit trails (walnut) in the host location process. The response of C. occidentalis to four Tephritid hosts was evaluated: the natural host R. completa, the factitious host Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and two fruit flies of economic importance, Rhagoletis cerasi Linnaeus and Bactrocera oleae (Rossi). In order to assess the response of the parasitoid, a number of behavioral parameters were considered, such as: arrestment behavior, resident time, walking distance, linear and angular speed. The larval trails of R. completa, as well as rotten-fruit liquid trails, were clearly detected by C. occidentalis females, even though the species has been reared for more than 80 generations on C. capitata. In addition, bioassays performed with C. capitata larvae showed a good behavioral response of parasitoid females to the larval trails. Finally, R. cerasi and B. oleae larval trails were barely detected in comparison to the traces left by R. completa and C. capitata larvae. The results are discussed in the light of the possible use of C. occidentalis in biological control programmes.},

The thermal environment to which fly larvae are exposed is the primary influence on their growth rate, and hence affects any estimate of minimum time since death using such specimens in homicide investigations. To date, much of the entomological research on maggot masses has focused on their elevation of carcass temperatures, with very little focus on the bacteria associated with larval activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the heat associated with decay and the types of bacteria present during the decomposition of a carcass, both in the presence and in the absence of maggots. Three treatments were imposed: fresh, frozen and maggot-infested, each consisting of five replicate pig carcasses. Temperature measurements and bacterial swabs were taken from the gastro-intestinal region of each pig and temperatures and bacterial communities compared between treatments. All carcasses reached average maximum temperatures above 32 °C in a temperature controlled room set at 23 °C. Treatment had no statistically significant effect on the temperatures recorded in each carcass but did significantly affect the community structure of the bacteria. However, bacterial community structure varied across time. This study suggests that bacterial metabolism plays a significant role in carcass thermogenesis, and that maggot masses, while contributing to localised heating within the carcass, may have less of a role in elevating carcass temperatures than previously assumed.},

	abstract = {Summary
Plagues of mass migrating insects such as locusts are estimated to affect the livelihood of one in ten people on the planet [1]. Identification of generalities in the mechanisms underlying these mass movements will enhance our understanding of animal migration and collective behavior while potentially contributing to pest-management efforts. We provide evidence that coordinated mass migration in juvenile desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) is influenced strongly by cannibalistic interactions. Individuals in marching bands tend to bite others but risk being bitten themselves. Reduction of individuals' capacity to detect the approach of others from behind through abdominal denervation (1) decreases their probability to start moving, (2) dramatically reduces the mean proportion of moving individuals in groups, and (3) significantly increases cannibalism. Similarly, occlusion of the rear visual field inhibits individuals' propensity to march. Abdomen denervation did not influence the behavior of isolated locusts. When within groups, abdominal biting and the sight of others approaching from behind triggers movement, creating an autocatalytic feedback that results in directed mass migration. This “forced march” driven by cannibalistic interactions suggests that we need to reassess our view of both the selection pressure and mechanism that can result in the coordinated motion of such large insect groups.},

	abstract = {Aphidophagous predators adapt their foraging behaviour to the presence of conspecific and heterospecific larvae. We studied the effect of the presence of conspecific larvae and their tracks on the oviposition site selection of an aphid-specific predator, Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera: Syrphidae), in two-choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Gas chromatography – mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the volatile chemicals released from odour extracts of E. balteatus larval tracks. The behavioural effects of these volatile substances on hoverfly females were also evaluated. Our experiments demonstrated that E. balteatus females were deterred from ovipositing when presented with a Vicia faba leaf with aphids and conspecific larvae. The oviposition-deterring stimulus was also active when females were presented with a leaf that contained conspecific larval tracks. A mixture of chemical compounds was found in the volatile pattern of odour extracts of larval tracks. The main volatile chemicals were 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hexanoic acid and phenol. Females also laid significantly fewer eggs in response to odorant volatiles emitted from larval extracts. These results highlight that predatory hoverfly females avoid ovipositing in aphid colonies in which conspecific larvae or their tracks are already present, suggesting that this behaviour constitutes a strategy that enables females to optimize their oviposition site and reduce competition suffered by their offspring.},

This study examines the mechanisms that govern aggregation behaviour specially the tendency of individuals to leave or join groups in the compost earthworm Eisenia fetida, a species with considerable economic importance, especially in waste management applications. Through behavioural assays combined with mathematical modelling, we provide the first evidence of self-assembled social structures in earthworms and describe key mechanisms involved in cluster formation. We found that the probability of an individual joining a group increased with group size, while the probability of leaving decreased. Moreover, attraction to groups located at a distance was observed, suggesting a role for volatile cues in cluster formation. The size of earthworm clusters appears to be a key factor determining the stability of the group. These findings enhance our understanding of intra-specific interactions in earthworms and have potential implications for extraction and collection of earthworms in vermicomposting processes.},

	copyright = {© 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},
	abstract = {The multicoloured Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), aggregates inside dwellings during winters to survive the cold. This beetle uses chemical cues coming from congeners to select an overwintering site. Recent research has shown that they preferentially gather at places where conspecifics previously laid a substrate marking made up of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Some authors have reported that H. axyridis colonizes the same overwintering sites from 1 year to another. Herein, the hypothesis that this substrate marking is used by H. axyridis to settle in the same aggregation sites from one winter to another was tested. To this aim, the temporal modification in the chemical profile of the hydrocarbon marking was studied by performing chromatographic analyses. After 1 year, the overall profile was modified qualitatively and quantitatively: the unsaturated hydrocarbons were no longer detected while some saturated hydrocarbons were still present in large quantities. In a behavioural assay conducted in the laboratory, the 12-month-old marking did not induce the aggregation of H. axyridis. This result indicates that the chemical markings left by conspecifics during a previous aggregation period in an overwintering site are not sufficient to induce the gathering of the newly arriving individuals.},

We investigated the extent to which boldness and shyness affect the distribution of social herbivores across vegetation patches, using sheep as a model species. Using an experimental and a theoretical approach, we show that collective choices emerge through the nonlinear dynamics of interactions between individuals, at both short and long distances. Within a range of parameter values derived from the observation of homogeneous groups of each behavioural type, we propose a simple mechanism whereby the same interaction rules can result in different patterns of distribution across patches for bold and shy individuals. We present a mathematical model based on behavioural rules derived from experiments, in which crowding and conspecific attraction affect the probability of entering or leaving patches. Variation in the strength of social attraction is sufficient to account for differences in spatial distribution across patches. The model predicts that resource fragmentation more strongly affects the distribution patterns of shy groups, and suggests that the presence of both bold and shy individuals within groups would result in more flexible behaviour at the population level.},

In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that a weak individual wall-following tendency in ants can be amplified by communication through chemical trails, leading to a response to the spatial heterogeneities at the collective level. In our experiments, ants had to cross a diamond-shaped bridge along either of two branches of equal length to get from their nest to a food source. Two types of bridge were used: control bridges without a wall, and experimental bridges equipped with a wall along the inner edge of one of their branches. On the control bridges, ants collectively chose either branch of the bridge in most experiments, whereas on the experimental bridges, the branch with the wall was selected almost systematically. A mathematical model is proposed to assess, in various conditions, the importance of the amplification effect of the chemical trail on the wall-following tendency observed at the individual level. The model highlights the fact that the amplification process can lead to an overestimation of individual capabilities and, thus, that the results of experiments investigating individual preferences at group level in animals must be interpreted with caution.},

	shorttitle = {Bigger isn't always better},
	abstract = {The effect of developmental temperature (18°C versus 25°C) on the body size and territorial success of male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, in paired contests was examined. When tested at ambient temperatures of either 18°C or at 27°C, adult males raised at 25°C were relatively small in size but nevertheless had greater territorial success (control of a food/oviposition resource) than males raised at 18°C. This result negates a ‘size-advantage hypothesis’, which predicts that males raised at 18°C should be more successful at either contest temperature by virtue of their larger size. It also negates an ‘acclimation-advantage hypothesis’, which predicts that males raised at 18°C should be more successful than males raised at 25°C in contests at 18°C, but less successful at 27°C. The data are consistent, however, with an ‘optimal developmental temperature hypothesis’, which suggests that flies raised at 25°C, even though phenotypically small, are physiologically vigorous and will perform relatively well under diverse environmental circumstances. Thus, bigger isn't always better. In a small-scale experiment territoriality scored only at 27°C) in which all males had the same developmental temperature (25°C) males whose parents developed at 25°C were more successful than were males whose parents developed at 18°C. These experiments demonstrate that developmental temperatures, both within and between generations, influence territorial success in male flies.},

	volume = {241},
	abstract = {Estimation of minimum post mortem interval commonly relies on predicting the age of blow fly larvae based on their size and an estimate of the temperatures to which they have been exposed throughout their development. The majority of larval growth rate data have been developed using small larval masses in order to avoid excess heat generation. The current study collected growth rate data for larvae at different mass volumes, and assessed the temperature production of these masses, for two forensically important blow fly species, Chrysomya rufifacies and Calliphora vicina. The growth rate of larvae in a small mass, exposed to the higher temperatures equivalent to those experienced by large masses, was also assessed to determine if observed differences were due to the known temperature effects of maggot masses. The results showed that temperature production increased with increasing mass volume, with temperature increases of 11 °C observed in the Ch. rufifacies large masses and increases of 5 °C in the large C. vicina masses. Similarly, the growth rate of the larvae was affected by mass size. The larvae from small masses grown at the higher temperatures experienced by large masses displayed an initial delay in growth, but then grew at a similar rate to those larvae at a constant 23 °C. Since these larvae from masses of equivalent sizes displayed similar patterns of growth rate, despite differing temperatures, and these growth rates differed from larger masses exposed to the same temperatures, it can be concluded that larval growth rate within a mass may be affected by additional factors other than temperature. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the role of massing in larval development and provides initial developmental data for mass sizes of two forensically important blow fly species commonly encountered in Australian forensic casework.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Traditionally the calculation of accumulated degree days or hours (ADD or ADH) involves the concept of a minimum threshold temperature below which development ceases. Hence in fluctuating conditions, where temperatures drop below this threshold, there may be periods of time when development is taken to be zero. This has important implications when the calculation of postmortem interval (PMI) is based on the ADD or ADH of larval dipterans. Normal development of larvae of the blowflies Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and C. vomitoria L. (Diptera: Calliphoridae) at 20°C was interrupted by cold episodes. The expectation was that total development time would increase by the period at low (therefore no development) temperature but the total ADD or ADH should be the same as non-cold treated cohorts. The results, however, showed that total ADH for both species decreased linearly with increasing temperature with no evidence of any minimum threshold temperature effect. The increased ADH at low temperatures may be due to either continued but reduced development or a delay in development restarting after the cold episode. Use of ADH in PMI estimations has shortcomings particularly during the winter period where low temperatures are involved or where there are sudden summer cold spells during the development period. As blowfly development progresses from egg to pupa such errors will be compounded.},

These findings have stimulated engineers to investigate approaches for the coordination of autonomous multirobot systems based on self-organization.

Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions. Even when in the minority, robots can modulate the collective decision-making process and produce a global pattern not observed in their absence.

	abstract = {The honeybee waggle dance, through which foragers advertise the existence and location of a food source to their hive mates, is acknowledged as the only known form of symbolic communication in an invertebrate. However, the suggestion, that different species of honeybee might possess distinct ‘dialects’ of the waggle dance, remains controversial. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether different species of honeybee can learn from and communicate with each other. This study reports experiments using a mixed-species colony that is composed of the Asiatic bee Apis cerana cerana (Acc), and the European bee Apis mellifera ligustica (Aml). Using video recordings made at an observation hive, we first confirm that Acc and Aml have significantly different dance dialects, even when made to forage in identical environments. When reared in the same colony, these two species are able to communicate with each other: Acc foragers could decode the dances of Aml to successfully locate an indicated food source. We believe that this is the first report of successful symbolic communication between two honeybee species; our study hints at the possibility of social learning between the two honeybee species, and at the existence of a learning component in the honeybee dance language.},

The preference showed age-dependent changes, which differed according to sex and nutritional history. Females in both nutrition groups showed a high preference for the odor. The preference of protein-fed females showed cyclic variations corresponding to the ovarian cycle, while the protein-deficient group, which never oviposited having immature eggs, did not exhibit cyclic changes and their preference remained high. These results suggest that the preference for the odor may be associated with the ovarian cycle. In males, both nutrition groups showed significant changes with age. The preference of protein-deficient males changed similarly to that of females, whereas protein-fed males were not attracted by the odor. This also suggests that the preference for the odor may be related to reproductive development.

A growing number of studies have also shown various effects of carrion on different plant and microbial communities. However, there has been no review of these studies to bring this information together and identify priority areas for future research. We review carrion ecology studies from the last two decades and summarise the range of spatial and temporal effects of carrion on soil nutrients, microbes, plants, arthropods, and vertebrates. We identify key knowledge gaps in carrion ecology, and discuss how closing these gaps can be achieved by focusing future research on the (1) different kinds of carrion resources, (2) interactions between different components of the carrion community, (3) the ways that ecosystem context can moderate carrion effects, and (4) considerations for carrion management. To guide this research, we outline a framework that builds on the ‘ephemeral resource patch’ concept, and helps to structure research questions that link localised effects of carrion with their consequences at landscape scales. This will enable improved characterisation of carrion as a unique resource pool, provide answers for land managers in a position to influence carrion availability, and establish the ways that carrion affects the dynamics of species diversity and ecological processes within landscapes.},

The results show distinguishing features within the hydrocarbon profile over the period of the larvae life cycle, with significant chemical changes occurring from the younger larvae to the postfeeding larvae. Further interpretation of the chromatograms using principal component analysis revealed a strong correlation between the magnitudes of particular principal components and time. This outcome suggests that, under the conditions of this study, the cuticular hydrocarbons evolve in a systematic fashion with time, thus supporting the potential for GC–MS analysis as a tool for establishing PMI where such a species is present.},

The spatial distribution of north temperate dung beetles (Aphodius, Sphaeridium, and Margarinotus) was investigated at three spatial scales (scale a between all pads - large spatial scale, small patch size; scale b between block - large spatial scale, large patch size; scalec within block - small spatial scale, small patch size) in the field using standardised and naturally dropped dung pads that varied in size and volume. 2. Results indicated that all the major colonising species of dung beetle expressed strong intraspecific aggregation, while interspecific aggregation, though present, was of a lesser magnitude. 3. In both controlled and natural dung treatments, intra- and interspecific aggregation decreased with increasing patch size (from pad to block) and also decreased with decreasing spatial scale (from whole plot to within-block scale). 4. The data also suggested that intraspecific aggregation was more important than interspecific aggregation in the distribution of adult dung beetles in natural and standardised dung pads and hence has the potential to facilitate coexistence. 5. Intra- and interspecific aggregation was greater in the natural dung compared with that of the standardised dung, and the effect of pad size partly explains this phenomenon. 6. The within-patch spatial distribution of dung beetles observed in the natural and standardised dung was possibly mediated through within-patch differences between the two treatments. Six confounding factors could explain this difference and these factors are discussed in relation to resource utilisation by north temperate dung beetles.},

	abstract = {The paper puts forward a model for the evolution of sociality and kin selection based on interspecific aggregation as a response to spatially restricted resources and predation. The presence of a gene which regulates inter-individual distance, termed "irritability" ("ir") is proposed and the model shows that individuals with a "non-irritable" ("nir") genotype, through association with conspecifics and other species, will tend to form groups with a higher survival rate of individuals. Mixed species groups will have lower costs to individuals than monospecific ones since competition is not for all resources, usually only one. Benefits in predation avoidance, however, would be equal to those of monospecific groups of the same size and may exceed them, if one of the associating species has an effective anti-predator mechanism which can be exploited by others. "Nir\&apos;s" will have a greater chance of interbreeding through spatial proximity and mate selection mechanisms and their offspring will also have a higher chance of survival by remaining within the aggregation rather than dispersing. Cultural transmission from parent to offspring of which aggregations are "successful" is postulated as playing a role in perpetuating certain aggregation types. This system is suggested as forming a basis on which processes such as kin selection and altruism could evolve.},

	abstract = {Desert locust Schistocerca gregaria outbreaks consistently start in the same places, suggesting that certain landscapes are particularly favourable for outbreaking. Outbreaks are generated by multiplication, concentration and gregarisation of locust populations. Previous research has shown how small-scale vegetation patterns in desert ecosystems influence locust gregarisation; the present study examines the effects of large-scale landscape structure on locust multiplication and concentration. NOAA/AVHRR satellite imagery was used to relate abundance and spatial distribution of resources at the landscape scale to the historical record of locust outbreaks. Threshold NDVI values were investigated to define what constitutes ‘resource’ for locusts. The first part of the study showed that abundance and spatial distribution of resource were not sufficient to distinguish between outbreak and non-outbreak areas in the western part of the locust distribution area. Thus, outbreak danger zones cannot be identified by landscape structure at this spatial resolution. The second analysis investigated spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation growth in two locust breeding areas with very different landscape structure; in both cases, the patterns differed significantly between outbreaking and non-outbreaking years. In Mauritania, a flat homogeneous desert landscape, both resource abundance and fragmentation were higher in outbreaking years. On the Red Sea coast, a fragmented landscape, resource spatial distribution was consistent between years, and abundance alone was a significant predictor of outbreaking. High resource abundance promotes locust multiplication, and contraction of resource into small patches increases locust concentration; these two mechanisms explain how landscape structure influences locust outbreaking.},

	abstract = {The aggregation model of species coexistence predicts that insect species diversity within a community is maintained by intraspecific aggregation among resource patches. An untested corollary of this prediction is that diversity within resource patches should decrease with increasing intraspecific aggregation. The recently derived species–aggregation relationship provides a general formulation of this prediction: as intraspecific aggregation increases within a geographic area, the species richness within samples of the area decreases. We tested this prediction by compiling and analyzing 76 data sets of arthropod species distribution and abundance. For each data set, we determined the mean amount of intra- and interspecific aggregation and three types of within-sample or local species diversity: species richness, evenness, and dominance. Using regression, we found a negative relationship between intraspecific aggregation and all three types of local diversity. Intraspecific aggregation explained a significant percentage of the variation in species diversity, typically between 20\% and 60\%. By comparison, interspecific aggregation usually explained {\textless}1\% of the variation in species diversity. Our study provides empirical support for the species–aggregation relationship as a general macroecological pattern that emerges from intraspecific aggregation.},

Mixed species groups of mammals occur in many different habitats, e.g. ungulates on the savannah, primates in various types of forests and cetaceans in the oceans. Mixed species groups are very different in their duration, frequency, predominant activity and structure depending on the species interacting and the habitat they occur in. 2. Functional explanations for mixed species groups usually fall within two categories: foraging advantages and predator avoidance. However, there could also be other social and reproductive advantages of mixed species groups that could contribute to their formation and stability. The advantages do not have to be equally distributed between the participating species and can also vary according to season and the presence of predators. 3. It is important that all investigators of mixed species groups take their studies one step further after the naturalistic description and test the function and benefits of mixed species groups in order to give more strength to their conclusions. In this paper we review and discuss the function of mixed species groups in mammals and suggest an approach on how to investigate the function of such groups.},

Sensor coils mounted on the thorax picked up externally generated magnetic fields and yielded measurements of the position and orientation of the thorax with a resolution of 1 ms, 0.3 degrees and 1 mm. Flight velocities inside the cage were up to 1.2 m s-1, and accelerations were up to 1 g (approximately 10 m s-2) vertically and 2 g horizontally. During flight, blowflies performed a series of short (approximately 20–30 ms) saccade-like turns at a rate of approximately 10 s-1. The saccades consisted of a succession of rotations around all axes, occurring in a fixed order. First, a roll was started. Second, the rolled thorax pitched (pulling the nose up) and yawed, resulting in a turn relative to the outside world. Finally, the thorax rolled back to a level position. Saccades had yaw amplitudes of up to 90 degrees, but 90 \% were smaller than 50 degrees. Maximum angular velocities were 2000 degrees s-1, and maximum accelerations were 10(5) degrees s-2. The latter correspond to torques consistent with the maximal force (2×10(−3)N) that can be generated by the flight motor as inferred from the maximal linear acceleration. Furthermore, the sequence of energy investment in consecutive rotations around different axes appears to be optimized during a saccade.},

	abstract = {A negative relationship between group size and levels of individual vigilance is widespread in socially feeding vertebrates. The main explanation of this ‘group-size effect’, the many-eyes hypothesis, is based on the simple premise that as group size increases, there are progressively more eyes scanning the environment for predators. Thus an individual forager can devote less time to vigilance (and more time to feeding) as group size increases without any lessening of the group's ability to detect an attack. Basic to this hypothesis is the assumption of collective detection: that all members of the group are alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one individual. In addition, an important presumption associated with the many-eyes hypothesis is that individuals monitor the vigilance behaviour of their groupmates in determining their own level of vigilance. Neither the idea of collective detection nor behavioural monitoring received strong support in an experimental study of vigilance in mixed flocks of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. The lack of support for behavioural monitoring was particularly evident; however, some degree of collective detection was apparent. It is possible that anti-predatory rules-of-thumb may explain the group-size effect while keeping intact the basics of the many-eyes hypothesis.},

Most females (66\%) laid live larvae only, but 18\% laid fully developed eggs (half of the egg masses laid by individual females were viable) and 16\% laid live larvae and some eggs at the same time. Females laying only eggs laid a mean of 24.1 ± 3.0, n = 10 eggs on each occasion. Field females carried between 20 and 44 live larvae (mean of 33.4 ± 1.0, n = 49) with a strong linear relationship between female size and number of live larvae. In the laboratory, females typically laid larvae in multiple locations. Very few females (\&lt;8\%) retained some larvae in their ovisacs, retaining on average, half of their complement of developed larvae. Those larvae retained had begun to be resorbed by the female with necrosis evident on the posterior segments.},

The relative spectral sensitivity of larvae of Calliphora vomitoria and C. erythrocephala has been determined, using the maggot's natural tendency to travel towards the weaker of two opposing lights.2. The response to light at each wavelength between 402 and 602 m\{micro\} was the same for the two species, within \{+/-\}0.1 log unit, and the results are well fitted by the bell-shaped curve characteristic of a (hypothetical) visual purple, maximal at 504 m\{micro\}.3. Reduction of the intensity of the white standard light by one log unit did not change the shape of the curve, and the extended wavelength range, between 362 and 640 m\{micro\}, shows no sign of a subsidiary maximum of sensitivity. The levels of illumination were 10-2 and 10-3 f.c., and the absolute threshold was found to be about 10-6 f.c.4. The spectral sensitivity found here is compared with the results of other workers for muscid flies and larvae. It is concluded that one of the independent maxima of sensitivity found in the flies is a continuance from the larval state.},

When the 2 species were kept together in artificially mixed colonies, changes in their chemical signatures were observed after only 2 h of cohabitation: each species acquired all the hydrocarbons specific to the other species, but R. lucifugus grassei acquired larger amounts of the R. santonensis hydrocarbons than vice versa. After a 24 h period of cohabitation, both the homospecific and allospecific signatures carried by all the individuals were in the same proportions as those characterizing the individuals of the 2 species prior to cohabitation. The other species' signature was therefore acquired additively, probably via physical contacts between the cohabiting individuals. After 14 days of cohabitation, however, changes in the amounts of some of the components synthesized by each species were observed, and the allospecific signature also differed from that acquired at the beginning of the experiment: a regulatory process involving quantitative changes in only some of the cuticular components was therefore at work. The results obtained with this artificially mixed colony model show that the hypotheses put forward up to now by previous authors about regulatory mechanisms of this kind are not in fact mutually exclusive, but may be applicable to various successive periods of cohabitation.},

	abstract = {Individuals need to coordinate their activities to benefit from group living. Thus group decisions are essential for societies, especially if group members cooperate with each other. Models show that shared (democratic) decisions outperform unshared (despotic) decisions, even if individuals disagree about actions. This is surprising as in most other contexts, differences in individual preferences lead to sex-, age-, or kin-specific behaviour. Empirical studies testing the predictions of the theoretical models have only recently begun to emerge. This applies particularly to group decisions in fission-fusion societies, where individuals can avoid decisions that are not in their interest. After outlining the basic ideas and theoretical models on group decision-making I focus on the available empirical studies. Originally most of the relevant studies have been on social insects and fish but recently an increasing number of studies on mammals and birds have been published, including some that deal with wild long-lived animals living in complex societies. This includes societies where group members have different interests, as in most mammals, and which have been less studied compared to eusocial insects that normally have no conflict among their colony members about what to do. I investigate whether the same decision rules apply in societies with conflict and without conflict, and outline open questions that remain to be studied. The chapter concludes with a synthesis on what is known about group decision-making in animals and an outlook on what I think should be done to answer the open questions.},

elicits the transition to gregarious phase behavior. The phase state of

logistic regression analysis. A significant switch from solitarious to
gregarious behavior occurred when the outer face of a hind femur had
been stimulated, but mechanical stimulation of 10 other body regions
did not result in significant behavioral change. We conclude that a
primary cause of the switch in behavior that seeds the formation of
locust swarms is individuals regularly touching others on the hind legs

It was hypothesised that the reason for this paratopic distribution is competition between larvae of the two species for food resources. 2. This hypothesis was tested by studying the performance of larvae of the two species in terms of their developmental success in mixed-species and single-species treatments under different air temperatures, relative humidities, substrate textures, and food abundance. 3. The number of individuals of X. conformis that survived until emergence depended significantly on the presence of competing species, being, in general, lower in mixed-species compared with single-species treatments. The decrease in developmental success of X. conformis in mixed-species treatments was found mainly during food shortage. In contrast, presence of the competitor did not affect the number of X. ramesis that survived until emergence. No effect of the presence of the competitor on duration of development or sex ratio was found in either species. 4. The results of this study, together with the results of our previous studies, provide an explanation for the paratopic distribution of X. conformis and X. ramesis that exploit the same host species.},

	shorttitle = {Accurate decisions in an uncertain world},
	abstract = {In a wide range of contexts, including predator avoidance, medical decision-making and security screening, decision accuracy is fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between true and false positives. Increased true positives are possible only at the cost of increased false positives; conversely, decreased false positives are associated with decreased true positives. We use an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to show that a group of decision-makers can overcome this basic limitation. Using a mathematical model, we show that a simple quorum decision rule enables individuals in groups to simultaneously increase true positives and decrease false positives. The results from a predator-detection experiment that we performed with humans are in line with these predictions: (i) after observing the choices of the other group members, individuals both increase true positives and decrease false positives, (ii) this effect gets stronger as group size increases, (iii) individuals use a quorum threshold set between the average true- and false-positive rates of the other group members, and (iv) individuals adjust their quorum adaptively to the performance of the group. Our results have broad implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of group-living animals and lend themselves for applications in the human domain such as the design of improved screening methods in medical, forensic, security and business applications.},

This book redresses that situation by providing both a synthesis of the existing literature and a new theory of social foraging. Giraldeau and Caraco develop models informed by game theory that offer a new framework for analysis. Social Foraging Theory contains the most comprehensive theoretical approach to its subject, coupled with quantitative methods that will underpin future work in the field. The new models and approaches that are outlined here will encourage new research directions and applications.  To date, the analysis of social foraging has lacked unifying themes, clear recognition of the problems inherent in the study of social foraging, and consistent interaction between theory and experiments. This book identifies social foraging as an economic interaction between the actions of individuals and those of other foragers. This interdependence raises complex questions about the size of foraging groups, the diversity of resources used, and the propensity of group members to exploit each other or forage cooperatively. The models developed in the book will allow researchers to test their own approaches and predictions. Many years in development, Social Foraging Theory will interest researchers and graduate students in such areas as behavioral ecology, population ecology, evolutionary biology, and wildlife management.},

	abstract = {The Allee effect is a positive causal relationship between any component of fitness and population density or size. Allee effects strongly affect the persistence of small or sparse populations. Predicting Allee effects remains a challenge, possibly because not all causal mechanisms are known. We hypothesized that reproductive interference (an interspecific reproductive interaction that reduces the fitness of the species involved) can generate an Allee effect. If the density of the interfering species is constant, an increase in the population of the species receiving interference may dilute the per capita effect of reproductive interference and may generate an Allee effect. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of heterospecific males on the relationship between per capita fecundity and conspecific density in Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus. Of the two species, only C. maculatus females suffer reproductive interference from heterospecific males. Only C. maculatus, the species susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated an Allee effect, and only when heterospecific males were present. In contrast, C. chinensis, the species not susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated no Allee effect regardless of the presence of heterospecific males. Our results show that reproductive interference in fact generated an Allee effect, suggesting the potential importance of interspecific sexual interactions especially in small or sparse populations, even in the absence of a shared resource. It may be possible to predict Allee effects produced by this mechanism a priori by testing reproductive interference between closely related species.},

Two abundant heteropteran predators, Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) and Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter co-occur in the tomato crops of the Mediterranean horticultural area where they both attack whiteflies and lepidoptera, the dominant herbivores in the crop. Experiments in the laboratory were used to assess the incidence of intraguild predation and cannibalism in these predators. The effects of these interactions on survivorship, progeny and within-plant distributions were studied, as well as the effect of the presence of M. pygmaeus on the damage caused by N. tenuis to tomato plants. When predators of different stages coexisted, only the mortality of M. pygmaeus second-third instar nymphs caused by N. tenuis adult females was observed. When predators of the same stage (second-third instar nymphs or adult females) coexisted, mortality caused by IGP and cannibalism was observed only between adult females and usually associated to the absence of additional prey. When adult females coexisted without additional prey, the progeny of both predator species were reduced, showing a relationship only with the density and not with the presence of other predator species. However, when additional prey was offered, only M. pygmaeus progeny were reduced, showing a higher capacity of N. tenuis to maintain their reproductive potential at high densities. When both predator species coexisted, N. tenuis adult females caused more damage to tomato plants, suggesting that their coexistence could affect the crop. The consequences of conspecific and heterospecific interactions of M. pygmaeus and N. tenuis are discussed for the biological control of whiteflies and other tomato pests.},

	abstract = {"Words are our tools, and, as a minimum, we should use clean tools. We should know what we mean and what we do not, and we must forearm ourselves against the traps that language sets us."  -- The Need for Precise Terminology, Austin (1957, 7–8)   It follows that, for effective and efficient communication, people should have, or at least understand, the same precise terminology. Such terminology is crucial for the advancement of basic, theoretical, and applied science, yet too often there is ambiguity between scientific and common definitions and even discrepancies in the scientific literature.  Providing a common ground and platform for precise scientific communication in animal behavior, ecology, evolution, and related branches of biology, Animal Behavior Desk Reference, A Dictionary of Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution, Third Edition contains more than 800 new terms and definitions, 48 new figures, and thousands of additions and improvements.   Using a dictionary format to present definitions in a standard, easily accessible manner, the book’s main body emphasizes conceptual terms, rather than anatomical parts or taxonomic terms, and focuses on nouns, rather than verbs or adjectives. Term hierarchies are handled with bulleted entries and terms with multiple definitions are included as superscripted entries. All sources are cited and most are paraphrased to conform to uniform style and length.  The dictionary also includes nontechnical and obsolete terms, synonyms, pronunciations, and notes and comments, as well as etymologies, term originators, and related facts. Appendices address organism names, organizations, and databases. Devoted to the precise and correct use of scientific language, this third edition of a bestselling standard enables students and scientists alike to communicate their findings and promote the efficient advancement of science.},

	abstract = {Cooperation and group living often evolves through kin selection. However, associations between unrelated organisms, such as different species, can evolve if both parties benefit from the interaction. Group living is rare in spiders, but occurs in cooperative, permanently social spiders, as well as in territorial, colonial spiders. Mixed species spider colonies, involving closely related species, have rarely been documented. We examined social interactions in newly discovered mixed-species colonies of theridiid spiders on Bali, Indonesia. Our aim was to test the degree of intra- and interspecific tolerance, aggression and cooperation through behavioural experiments and examine the potential for adoption of foreign brood. Morphological and genetic analyses confirmed that colonies consisted of two related species Chikunia nigra (O.P. Cambridge, 1880) new combination (previously Chrysso nigra) and a yet undescribed Chikunia sp. Females defended territories and did not engage in cooperative prey capture, but interestingly, both species seemed to provide extended maternal care of young and indiscriminate care for foreign brood. Future studies may reveal whether these species adopt only intra-specific young, or also inter-specifically. We classify both Chikunia species subsocial and intra- and interspecifically colonial, and discuss the evolutionary significance of a system where one or both species may potentially benefit from mutual tolerance and brood adoption.},

	abstract = {Wingless locust nymphs can form massive migratory groups known as bands, whose coordinated movement results from local interactions. We analysed the spatial distribution of locusts within naturally occurring bands and compared them with computer simulations to infer which interaction rules are used by individuals. We found that the empirical radial distribution of neighbours around a focal individual was isotropic, indicating a tendency for locusts to interact with neighbours all around them, rather than a bias towards pursuing individuals ahead or escaping from the ones following behind. By using maps of neighbour densities and pair correlation functions, we found evidence for a short-range repulsion force, balanced by a clustering force, presumably alignment and/or attraction, at a distance of around 3 cm. These results were similar to those observed when using a ‘zonal’ self-propelled particles model where repulsion/alignment/attraction forces are delimited by concentric circular zones of set radii. However, the profiles obtained either by using different combinations of forces, limiting the number of neighbours involved in interactions, or by varying the range of some zones, all appeared to produce similar results, thereby limiting the ability to more precisely determine the rules underlying locust interactions.},

Larvae defective for the painless TRP receptor, or blocked in the function of class IV multi-dendritic sensory dendrites respond to this stimulus at reproducibly higher temperature (34°C). The escape response has novel behavioral components and a lower temperature threshold in comparison with the responses to touch with a hot needle. Furthermore the assay minimizes operator bias that is present in current tests of thermosensitive nociception and generates a precise determination of temperature at the point of response. This response is highly reproducible and directly applicable to genetic and neural circuit analysis of a simple escape behavior.},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

To facilitate the movement of sometimes millions of individuals on uneven and unpredictable terrains, part of the ant workers link together their legs and bodies to form temporary bridges over gaps along the trails. In this work we showed that these bridges were formed readily when the flow of ants hit an unspanned gap and were dismantled very quickly after traffic has ceased on the trail. However, we also observed that the bridges were formed and remained stable under a large spectrum of the traffic intensities on the trail. Using field experiments and computer simulations we discovered the construction rules used by the ants to create these living structures that are capable of enduring variations of the traffic while remaining highly responsive to its interruption. These results offer important insights about the mechanisms that regulate biological self-assemblies and they have potential applications in swarm robotics and swarm intelligence.},

	title = {Aggregation and species coexistence in fleas parasitic on small mammals},

	abstract = {The aggregation model of coexistence states that species coexistence is facilitated if interspecific aggregation is reduced relative to intraspecific aggregation. We investigated the relationship between intraspecific and interspecific aggregation in 17 component communities (the flea assemblage of a host population) of fleas parasitic on small mammals and hypothesized that interspecific interactions should be reduced relative to intraspecific interactions, facilitating species coexistence. We predicted that the reduction of the level of interspecific aggregation in relation to the level of intraspecific aggregation would be positively correlated with total flea abundance and species richness of flea assemblages. We also expected that the higher degree of facilitation of flea coexistence would be affected by host parameters such as body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and depth and complexity of burrows. Results of this study supported the aggregation model of coexistence and demonstrated that, in general, a) conspecific fleas were aggregated across their hosts; b) flea assemblages were not dominated by negative interspecific interactions; and c) the level of interspecific aggregation in flea assemblages was reduced in relation to the level of intraspecific aggregation. Intraspecific aggregation tended to be correlated positively to body mass, burrow complexity and mass-independent BMR of a host. Positive interspecific associations of fleas tended to occur more frequently in species-rich flea assemblages and/or in larger hosts possessing deep complex burrows. Intraspecific aggregation increased relative to interspecific aggregation when species richness of flea infracommunities (the flea assemblage of a host individual) and component communities increased. We conclude that the pattern of flea coexistence is related both to the structure of flea communities and affinities of host species.},

	abstract = {Gregarious nymphs of Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria migratorioides are often seen to march together in common bands in the field. In the present study, the intraspecific aggregation responses of nymphal and older stages of the two insects were compared with their interspecific responses. Unlike S. gregaria, L. m. migratorioides shows a lesser pattern of stage and sex differentiation in its aggregation pheromone biology. Thus, although fifth-instar nymphs did not respond significantly to the adult pheromone, adults responded significantly to the nymph pheromone. No cross- stage aggregative responses occur in S. gregaria. In the adults of S. gregaria, production of the pheromone is male-specific; in L. m. migratorioides both sexes induced a significant level of aggregation from conspecifics. Aggregation assays between corresponding stages of the two species showed stronger interaction between the nymphal stages than between the adults and account for the frequent occurrence of mixed hopper bands in the field. GC-EAD studies of volatiles of nymphal and adult stages by using antennal preparations from both species also showed significant interspecies reactivities. GC-MS analyses showed that of S. gregaria nymphal pheromone components (C6 and C8 to C10 straight-chained aldehydes and acids and the fecal phenols, guaiacol and phenol), the acids and phenols constitute the common components of nymphal stages, Phenylacetonitrile, the major component of S. gregaria adult aggregation pheromone, is present in L. m. migratorioides nymphal volatiles, albeit at a lower level. Unlike S. gregaria adult pheromone blend, which is made up wholly of benzene derivatives, the volatile emissions of L. m. migratorioides adults is dominated by aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols. The possible role of cross-aggregation effects in mutually facilitating phase transformation of the two species is discussed.},

The range in pupal duration was 7-61 d for H. tarandi, and 7.6-43.5 d for C. trompe. C. trompe developed significantly faster than H. tarandi, and males in both species eclosed 1-4 d before females. Rate of development as a function of temperature was described with a nonlinear, 3-parameter model. Flies also were reared in the field in 1990, 1991, and 1992, and microtemperatures within puparia were logged to be applied in the model obtained at constant temperatures. The predicted eclosion dates were close to the median observed dates. The daily rate of development was then regressed on standard macrometeorological records (predictors lIsed were daily mean and maximum temperatures, Julian day, and cloud cover) in a multiple linear regression (r2 ≍0.80). This model was used to predict eclosion for 14 selected summers (1972-1993) at 1 meteorological station (Suolovuopmi), and at 8 different stations in northern Norway in 1992. Difference in eclosion dates among years ranged up to 40 d, and in cold summers eclosion takes place so late that few eggs or larvae are likely to be transmitted to the host, Rangifer tarandus (L.). Summer climate is hypothesized to be responsible for differences observed among years in larval infestation levels.},

	abstract = {Associative plasticity is a basic essential attribute of nervous systems. As shown by numerous reports, Drosophila is able to establish simple forms of appetitive and aversive olfactory associations at both larval and adult stages. Whereas most adult studies on aversive learning employed electric shock as a negative reinforcer, larval paradigms essentially utilized gustatory stimuli to create negative associations, a discrepancy that limits the comparison of data. To overcome this drawback, we critically revisited larval odor–electric shock conditioning. First, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl), which was used in all previous larval electric shock paradigms, is not required per se in larval odor–electric shock learning. This is of considerable practical advantage because beside its peculiar effects LiCl is attractive to larvae at low concentration that renders comparative learning studies on genetically manipulated larvae complicated. Second, we confirm that in both a 2-odor reciprocal and a 1-odor nonreciprocal conditioning regimen, larvae are able to associate an odor with electric shock. In the latter experiments, initial learning scores reach an asymptote after 5 training trials, and aversive memory is still detectable after 60 min. Our experiments provide a comprehensive basis for future comparisons of larval olfactory conditioning reinforced by different modalities, for studies aimed at analyzing odor–electric shock learning in the larva and the adult, and for investigations of the cellular and molecular substrate of aversive olfactory learning in the simple Drosophila model.},

	abstract = {Locust swarms are spectacular and damaging manifestations of animal collective movement. Here, we capture fundamental features of locust mass movement in the field, including a strongly non-linear relationship between collective alignment and density known only from earlier theoretical models and laboratory experiments. Migratory bands had a distinct structure, with a single high-density peak at the front, where collective alignment was high, followed by an exponential decay in density. As predicted by theory, alignment decreased with decreasing density, and fluctuations of movement direction became large until order amongst group members at the back of the band was totally lost. Remarkably, we found that the coordinated movement of migratory bands, which can be several kilometres wide and contain many millions of individuals, results from interactions occurring at a scale of 13.5 cm or less. Our results indicate that locust band structure and dynamics differ markedly from what is known (or assumed) about other large moving groups such as fish schools or bird flocks, yet they still conform to key general predictions made by collective movement models that explain how billions of individuals can align using local interactions.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {The encounter rate of focal individuals of Armadillidium vulgare in experimental arenas increased with increasing density of other isopods. This increase was only significantly more than would be predicted from a random encounter model when the additional animals were of a different species, Porcellio scaber. Increasing density of both species resulted in focal individuals spending a higher proportion of time walking while in high quality food patches, and a smaller proportion of their time feeding on the high quality food. This was only significant when the high quality food was most heterogeneously distributed and was more significant following encounters with P. scaber than with other A. vulgare. At higher densities focal individuals alternated turns less while searching in the low quality food matrix Relative growth rates and survivorship were both higher at higher population densities (278 m–2) than in the low density treatments of 28 m–2. We suggest that at low densities, which are below those observed for three field populations over twenty years, the advantages of having additional individuals with which to aggregate while sheltering may outweigh the costs of increased interference competition during foraging. The effects of spatial heterogeneity of food resources on interference competition between species differing in aggressiveness are discussed. The possible advantages of aggregating with another species, that has different morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to the terrestrial environment, while sheltering are examined in relation to the Allee effect of the positive fitness consequences of increasing population densities from very low levels.},

Use of this ratio allows a test of the null hypothesis that species do not covary among samples. As the test is simultaneous it is preferable to pairwise 2 X 2 contingency table analysis and pairwise correlation analysis when the number of species is large. Simulation reveals that this test is also more powerful than Pearson's g2 test for comparing observed and expected frequency distributions of species in samples. The variance test was applied to a selection of data from the literature. Results reveal that positive associations are the rule in nature and negative associations are uncommon. Invertebrate species tend to be more positively associated among samples than are vertebrates, although the difference is not significant. Examples of biological processes, especially interspecific interactions, that might produce associations among species are suggested. However one must be cautious not to infer the importance or unimportance of a specific process from the result of the test alone.  See full-text article at JSTOR},

Overall niche overlap between species reached a maximum of 49.9\% betweenB. brevipilosa andC. calliptera. Co-occurence ofE. betulae with both other species on leaves was random while co-occurrence ofC. calliptera andB. brevipilosa was aggregated. Morphological features (stylet length and body weight) act to mediate niche organization within this guild. California populations ofE. betulae andB. brevipilosa appear to utilize resources in a fashion similar to endemic Danish populations. Whereas DanishC. calliptera usually feed inside leaves silked together by spiders or Lepidoptera,C. calliptera in California also commonly feed on exposed leaf surfaces. This species, which has thus expanded its endemic niche, occupies the most generalized niche of the three species studied.},

Assays were carried out on two larval products to analyse the substrate specificity of these proteases, their abundance and approximate molecular weights. Tryptic and chymotryptic activities were found in both products though there were more chymotrypsin-like enzymes in products from 48 h cultures (CESP) than in product collected direct from 48 h larvae (LESP). Sodium dodecyi sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels incubated with azocasein showed plaques of major enzyme activity at molecular weights of 20,000 and 26,000 in LESP and at 20,000 in CESP. SDS-PAGE gels, when reacted with peptide substrates showed tryptic activity at 20,000 and 26,000 in LESP, whereas CESP showed only chymotryptic activity at 20,000 and higher molecular weights. The results suggest at least three enzymes, a trypsin and chymotrypsin in LESP, a chymotrypsin in CESP and a tryptic enzyme which is not stable to SDS-PAGE probably in both LESP and CESP. In addition, reactivity with elastase and plasmin substrates suggests the presence of enzymes with general effects on skin substrates and inflammatory pathways.},

Multiple regressions with data collected on 11 occasions on fixed back-reef and fore-reef sites suggested that the densities of the congener, other crevice-dwellers, and predators did not significantly affect the density of P. argus in either reef zone, or of P. guttatus on the back-reef, where coexistence of both lobster species was greatest. In contrast, there was a significant negative relationship between predators and the density of P. guttatus on the fore-reef, where this species was dominant. Congeneric cohabitation in dens was less than expected by chance, but this pattern may reflect a differential use of shelter resources rather than interspecific competition. P. guttatus was more prevalent in dens over the middle and upper third of the reef profile, and P. argus over the lower and middle third of the reef profile. Whether individuals cohabited with conspecifics, congeners, or resided solitarily, P. guttatus was more prevalent at the walls and/or ceiling and P. argus on the floor of dens. This differential use of shelter resources may be related to the differential vulnerability to predators, which may have promoted local coexistence of these congeners in reef habitats.},

Already Galton [Galton F (1907) Nature 75:7] found evidence that the median estimate of a group can be more accurate than estimates of experts. This wisdom of crowd effect was recently supported by examples from stock markets, political elections, and quiz shows [Surowiecki J (2004) The Wisdom of Crowds]. In contrast, we demonstrate by experimental evidence (N = 144) that even mild social influence can undermine the wisdom of crowd effect in simple estimation tasks. In the experiment, subjects could reconsider their response to factual questions after having received average or full information of the responses of other subjects. We compare subjects’ convergence of estimates and improvements in accuracy over five consecutive estimation periods with a control condition, in which no information about others’ responses was provided. Although groups are initially “wise,” knowledge about estimates of others narrows the diversity of opinions to such an extent that it undermines the wisdom of crowd effect in three different ways. The “social influence effect” diminishes the diversity of the crowd without improvements of its collective error. The “range reduction effect” moves the position of the truth to peripheral regions of the range of estimates so that the crowd becomes less reliable in providing expertise for external observers. The “confidence effect” boosts individuals’ confidence after convergence of their estimates despite lack of improved accuracy. Examples of the revealed mechanism range from misled elites to the recent global financial crisis.},

	abstract = {The invasive multicolored Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), aggregates inside dwellings during winter to avoid cold weather. This adaptive behavior disturbs homeowners, because of the large numbers of individuals that aggregate, which induces allergic reactions. The migratory flight patterns of this species have been well documented, with individuals preferentially moving toward prominent and high color contrast elements. However, the factors involved in the selection of aggregation sites by this species have yet to be elucidated. Here, we evaluated the influence of (i) the density of individuals and (ii) the type of available shelters on decisions by H. axyridis to settle and aggregate under shelters. A dual choice bioassay conducted in the laboratory demonstrated the presence of mutual attraction to conspecifics. We also found that individuals preferentially settled under red covered shelters compared to transparent shelters, and that the type of shelter outweighed the effect of social interactions among conspecifics. Moreover, this experiment was performed under non-wintering conditions, providing the first evidence that aggregative behavior in this species can also occur under those specific conditions.

	abstract = {Nest site selection significantly affects fitness, so adaptations for assessment of the qualities of available sites are expected. The assessment may be based on personal or social information, the latter referring to the observed location and performance of both conspecific and heterospecific individuals. Contrary to large-scale breeding habitat selection, small-scale nest site selection within habitat patches is insufficiently understood. We analyzed nest site selection in the migratory Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis in relation to present and past cues provided by conspecifics and by resident tits within habitat patches by using long-term data. Collared Flycatchers preferred nest boxes that were occupied by conspecifics in the previous year. This preference was strongest in breeding pairs where both individuals bred in the same forest patch in the previous year. The results also suggest preference for nest boxes close to boxes where conspecifics had a high breeding success in the previous year, and for nest boxes which are presently surrounded by a high number of breeding Great Tits Parus major. The results indicate social information use in nest site selection at a small spatial scale, where Collared Flycatchers use conspecific cues with a time lag of one year and heterospecific cues instantly. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {The patterns of hydrocarbon synthesis and transport to the epicuticle were examined in males and females of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), during the last nymphal stadium. Methods used to extract hydrocarbon from insects were validated in detail. A double hexane extraction for cuticular hydrocarbons and a triple chloroform-metha-nol extraction of homogenized insects for internal lipids removed essentially all hydrocarbon from the respective compartments, whereas the external extraction did not remove hydrocarbon from the interior of the insect. Synthesis in vivo was measured by the incorporation of [1-14C] propionate into methyl-branched hydrocarbon at 2-d intervals throughout the stadium. In both sexes, hydrocarbons were synthesized at increasing rates during the first 2/3 of the stadium, then synthesis ceased 2 d before the imaginal molt. Hydrocarbon synthesis was related to stage-specific food intake in both male and female nymphs. A declining proportion, but relatively constant quantity, of newly synthesized hydrocarbon was transported to the epicuticle as the nymph progressed through the intermolt period. The majority of the newly synthesized hydrocarbon at all ages was retained internally, however, suggesting that they serve as a source of epicuticular and ovarian hydrocarbon in the adult. Gas-liquid chromatography confirmed the patterns of hydrocarbon synthesis and showed a greater accumulation of hydrocarbons internally than on the nymphal epicuticle. Early in the last stadium, the majority of internal hydrocarbon is in the hemolymph, whereas late in the stadium the fraction of internal hydrocarbon in the hemolymph declines, presumably as newly synthesized hydrocarbon begin to associate with fat body and the developing imaginal cuticle.},

A large diversity of species has developed kin recognition abilities, allowing individuals to discriminate conspecifics in relation to relatedness. In social insects, many studies showed that discrimination generally acts at the level of nestmateship and only few studies report kin recognition abilities. Our results highlight the importance of kin recognition in shaping social life in the urban cockroach Blattella germanica (L.) and present a complete description of the recognition system from expression to action components. Cockroaches of all developmental stages (nymphs and adults) discriminate siblings from nonsiblings independently of any prior social experience. Preference is context dependent so that siblings are preferred as social partners, whereas nonsiblings are preferred as mating partners. Discrimination is based on quantitative differences of cuticular hydrocarbons that are perceived through antennal contacts. As individual cuticular profiles remain stable over time, they constitute reliable discrimination cues correlated with relatedness. Our results offer interesting perspectives for the study of kin recognition and for the understanding of evolution toward sociality in insects.},

The response to light at each wavelength between 402 and 602 m\{micro\} was the same for the two species, within \{+/-\}0.1 log unit, and the results are well fitted by the bell-shaped curve characteristic of a (hypothetical) visual purple, maximal at 504 m\{micro\}.3. Reduction of the intensity of the white standard light by one log unit did not change the shape of the curve, and the extended wavelength range, between 362 and 640 m\{micro\}, shows no sign of a subsidiary maximum of sensitivity. The levels of illumination were 10-2 and 10-3 f.c., and the absolute threshold was found to be about 10-6 f.c.4. The spectral sensitivity found here is compared with the results of other workers for muscid flies and larvae. It is concluded that one of the independent maxima of sensitivity found in the flies is a continuance from the larval state.},

Sometimes the positive photoreaction occurs only at high temperatures (Porcellio), a pattern of behavior correlated with thermoregulation by evaporative cooling. Similarly, in mesic species the response to humidity becomes less significant than in littoral species, resuming importance mainly when the isopods become dehydrated (Armadillidium).Finally, in isopods from xeric habitats in semi-arid and desert regions (Armadillo, Venezillo), photoreaction is strongly negative except in Hemilepistus at lower temperatures. All of these isopods are positively hygrokinetic only at low humidities and are strongly negatively thermoactive, indicating a drop in activity at high temperatures. The photonegative response in these isopods is stronger than the hygroreaction.},

	abstract = {Collective decision-making processes emerge from social feedback networks within a group. Many studies on collective behaviour underestimate the role of individual personality and, as a result, personality is rarely analysed in the context of collective dynamics. Here, we show evidence of sheltering behaviour personality in a gregarious insect (Periplaneta americana), which is characterized by a collective personality at the group level. We also highlight that the individuals within groups exhibited consistent personality traits in their probability of sheltering and total time sheltered during the three trials over one week. Moreover, the group personality, which arises from the synergy between the distribution of behaviour profiles in the group and social amplifications, affected the sheltering dynamics. However, owing to its robustness, personality did not affect the group probability of reaching a consensus. Finally, to prove social interactions, we developed a new statistical method that will be helpful for future research on personality traits and group behaviour. This approach will help to identify the circumstances under which particular group compositions may improve the fitness of individuals in gregarious species.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial isopods are known to be sensitive to humidity, brightness or temperature. Until now, aggregation was assumed to depend on these sensitivities as a result of individual preferences. In this paper, we show that the social component is also important in the isopod aggregation phenomenon. In experimental arenas with two identical shelters up to nearly 90\% of woodlice aggregated under shelters. This aggregation was quick as in 10 minutes most of the animals aggregated, irrespective of their density. Nonetheless, 10–15\% of the animals walked around the arena, rarely forming very small and short-lasting aggregates outside shelters. Woodlice aggregated preferably under one of the shelters in 77\% of experiments. Indeed, almost 80\% of the animals out of 40, 60 or 80 animals in the arena aggregated under one shelter. In arenas with 100 individuals the aggregations were proportionally smaller (70\%). Our results revealed that 70 animals was a maximum number of woodlice in an aggregate. We concluded that the location of aggregates is strongly governed by individual preferences but the dynamics of aggregation and collective choice are controlled by social interaction between congeners. The tested densities of the animals in the arena did not impact the aggregation patterns.},

Five types of receptors were found in the distal part of the dorsal organ: (1) The dome, whose ultrastructure is similar to that of thin-walled pegs, is assumed to be an olfactory receptor. (2) A lateral pore receptor, with the distal tips of two dendrites exposed to the exterior through a pore, is presumed to be a contact chemoreceptor. (3) A scolopidium-like receptor, with an ultrastructure characteristic of a scolopidium receptor except that the dendrite might be exposed to the exterior through an opening, is assumed to be both a mechanoreceptor and contact chemoreceptor. (4) Two receptors, each with one of its two dendrites exposed to the exterior, are probably contact chemoreceptors. (5) Two unclassified receptors, each with one dendritic tip exposed to the exterior and the other dendrite with a tubular body ending near the pore, may serve as both contact chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors. The last four types are located in the invagination between the dome and the cylindrical portion of the dorsal organ. The seven basal pores of the dome are apparently points of origin of the scolopales and have no sensory function. The dorsal organ is supplied by 35–41 bipolar neurons, indicating the possibility of additional undescribed receptors.},

In group-living species, when adults do not disperse, assessment of relatedness between conspecifics can be a key factor for choosing mates. Here, we report for the first time, kin recognition abilities and their implication in mate choice in the gregarious cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Binary choice tests showed that females mated preferentially with nonsibling rather than with sibling males, thus avoiding incest. In addition, inbreeding induced an important decrease of their reproductive success. Contrary to what could be expected when females had the choice between a nonsibling strain member and a nonstrain member, they did not avoid mating with distantly related nonstrain members, and extreme outbreeding induced an increase of their reproductive success. Furthermore, our mate choice experiments disentangled the influences of familiarity from those of relatedness and evidenced that kin discrimination was based on genetic cues independently of familiarity. Phenotype matching was a plausible mechanism for kin recognition. Contrary to many insect species, body size was not a salient criterion for mate choice and had no consequences on reproductive success.},

However, empirical evidence testing and validating this prediction is scarce. In particular, whereas inbreeding avoidance is expected to induce sexual conflicts, in some cases both partners could benefit by acting in concert and exerting mutual mate choice for non-assortative pairings. We tested this prediction with the gregarious cockroach Blattella germanica (L.). We demonstrated that males and females base their mate choice on different criteria and that choice occurs at different steps during the mating sequence. Males assess their relatedness to females through antennal contacts before deciding to court preferentially non-siblings. Conversely, females biased their choice towards the most vigorously courting males that happened to be non-siblings. This study is the first to demonstrate mutual mate choice leading to close inbreeding avoidance. The fact that outbred pairs were more fertile than inbred pairs strongly supports the adaptive value of this mating system, which includes no “best phenotype” as the quality of two mating partners is primarily linked to their relatedness. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of inbreeding conflict models.},

	abstract = {The chapter discusses an emerging area of study: that of applying self-organization theory to mobile vertebrate groups composed of many interacting individuals such as bird flocks, ungulate herds, fish schools, and human crowds in an attempt to improve our understanding of underlying organizational principles. Mathematical modeling is becoming increasingly recognized as an important research tool when studying collective behavior. The chapter presents the interaction dynamics among individuals result in the formation, internal structuring, and collective behaviors of vertebrate groups. The chapter explores the distribution of grouping individuals over larger spatial and temporal scales, and discusses how individual behaviors lead to population-level dynamics. Behavioral differences among individuals within a group may have an important internal structuring influence. By using simulation models, it can be shown how individuals can modify their positions relative to other group members without necessitating information about their current position within the group. In considering self-organization within vertebrate groups it is evident that the organization at one level, for example, that of the group relates to that at higher levels. For example, self-sorting processes that lead to internal structuring within groups also result in population-level patterns when such groups fragment, thus affecting the probability that an individual will be in a group of a given size and composition at any moment in time. These population properties then feed back to the individual interactions by changing the probability of encounters among different members of a population. The chapter concludes that to understand collective behaviors fully, these properties cannot necessarily be considered in isolation.},

On the 22km shoreline of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, these aggregations were on the average 0.8 km apart, and they were usually found day after day in the same ocations. Most beetles apparently do not ‘home’ to the aggregation of their origin after dispersing at night because (a) the species composition of some aggregations changed greatly, and (b) paint-marked beetles (Dineutus horni) moved overnight from one aggregation as far as 4km, joining 11 of the 14 large ({\textgreater}300 beetles) D. horni groups on the lake. Throughout the night, the largest concentrations of beetles remained within 100m of the diurnal aggregation sites. Beetles reconvened into the compact rafts before daybreak, in part by following each other in sometimes long single files or ‘trains’. Their forward motion stopped after they joined large number of other beetles. We infer that following behavior enables those individuals that have dispersed from their original aggregations (during their nocturnal foraging) to find and join other aggregations before daylight. Naive fish ate the beetles despite their noxious secretions. However, fish living near rafting sites and feeding on insects on the water surface in daylight should soon learn to avoid the beetles. The rafting sites would then become ‘safe’ places. We observed fish attacking only those beetles that had been either dispersed from their rafts or released into open water away from raft sites in the daytime. We speculate that the evolutionary significance of the aggregation behavior is related to predator (fish) avoidance.},

This has led to significant challenges in teasing apart the various mechanisms thought to underpin multispecies groups. One potentially useful approach for gaining an understanding of this process is to identify the rules that best predict the observed distribution of individuals across these groups. In order to gain an insight into the decision-making process that might generate patterns of heterospecific associations, we collected data on the number and distribution of nests in breeding colonies that contained 3 species of weaverbird. We found no evidence of segregation by species, either within or between colonies. Using agent-based simulations of males applying different rules of attraction and repulsion to conspecifics or heterospecifics, we found that the best-fitting rule contained no heterospecific attraction. In this rule, individuals picked colonies based on an optimal distribution of conspecific nests. Given that nests are an important sexual signal in weavers, our findings suggest that this rule is biologically relevant: Males are seeking an optimal trade-off between attracting females via lekking and competing for mates if too many conspecific nests are present. © The Author 2014.},

	volume = {202},
	abstract = {Aggregation is one of the most basic social phenomena, and many activities of social insects are linked to it. For instance, the selection of a valuable site and the spatial organization of the population are very often by-products of amplifications based on the local density of nestmates. The patterns of aggregation are very diverse, ranging from the gathering of all animals in a unique site to their splitting between several ones. One might question how these multiple patterns emerge. Do ants actively initiate the formation of such patterns by modulating the emission of an attracting signal such as the trail pheromone? Alternatively, do patterns result from quantitative changes in the duration of interaction between animals once they have reached the gathering site, without any active modulation of the communications? To discuss these questions, we present two empirical studies: the gregarious behavior of cockroaches (Blatella) and self-assembly in the weaver ant (Oecophylla). Through experimental and theoretical studies, we show how a single behavior--the resting time--leads to a collective choice in both species. This behavior is a response to the density of conspecifics and can also be modulated by heterogeneities in the environment. In weaver ants, it allows the colony to focus the formation of chains in a given area among several potential sites. In cockroaches, it allows the gathering of individuals in particular shelters, depending on the proximity between strains. These results are discussed with emphasis on the role of aggregation processes in the emergence of cooperativity and task allocation.},

Studies on fleeing behaviour have focused on the information spread initiated by a few stimulated individuals. Our goal was to link individuals' responses to the collective fleeing dynamics for gregarious insects simultaneously exposed to a stimulus. We found that an information cascade process occurs in groups of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, simultaneously exposed to a light stimulus. Moreover, the global fleeing pattern depended on group size. The steps of the response (reacting to the stimulus, finding an opening and leaving the shelter) differed in their sensitivity to group size. First, immobile individuals inhibited the fleeing response, while moving individuals amplified it. Second, once individuals had reacted, they reached an opening and stopped. Their low probability per unit time of finding this opening was constant regardless of group size or the mobility level of group members. Finally, the individual probability of leaving the shelter increased with the number of moving individuals still inside. We integrated the different behavioural steps, analysed independently, into a stochastic model. The results based on this model are in agreement with our experimental observations. This model constitutes a template that enables the exploration of the influence of environmental and social factors at work in other species and situations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Latent fingermarks developed by cyanoacrylate fuming often lack contrast; therefore further enhancement is required, such as dye staining. This second step is part of the conventional detection sequences performed by forensics practitioners. Dye-staining or powder dusting aims at improving contrast and at increasing the legibility of details, yet their use may at times be limited. Indeed powder dusting may not be effective due to unexpected adherence to the background, and poor affinity to the cyanoacrylate. In the same way staining processes can dye a whole semi-porous surface or may wash the marks.

To avoid that second step, a new luminescent cyanoacrylate (Lumicyano™) which allows one-step development without changing the fuming chamber settings (80\% humidity rate, 120 °C fuming temperature) was developed and assessed. This study aimed at comparing Lumicyano™ to a conventional two-step process. A detailed sensitivity study was conducted on glass slides, as well as the processing of various non-porous and semi-porous substrates, usually considered as problematic for a dye staining step.

The results indicate that Lumicyano™ detects fingermarks with equal or better sensitivity and ridge details than currently used cyanoacrylate. Secondly in luminescent mode, good ridges clarity and excellent contrast are observed, even if Lumicyano™ is sometimes less bright than the two-step process. Furthermore, conventional enhancement can still be carried out if needed. As a conclusion, Lumicyano™ makes it possible to avoid an enhancement step which can be detrimental to further examinations, particularly on rough or semi-porous surfaces.},

Many species of woodlice are synanthropic and, for this reason, are easily observable in gardens, urban parks or composts. Harmless organisms and easy to raise, the woodlice represent an excellent pedagogical model in many schools, so that children may perform on these organisms various behavioral tests such as light escape or introduction to social behaviors. Indeed, woodlice are gregarious species and exhibit long phases of aggregation. Here, we propose a model based on simple rules involving calmed and excited individuals and a social transition between these two behavioural states to explain group cohesion in woodlice. This contagion model well reproduces our experimental results. Our approach provides important clues for the understanding of how social group effects and collective mechanisms may govern the stability and dispersion of aggregates in gregarious arthropods.},

	abstract = {During consensus decision making, individuals in groups balance personal information (based on their own past experiences) with social information (based on the behavior of other individuals), allowing the group to reach a single collective choice. Previous studies of consensus decision making processes have focused on the informational aspects of behavioral choice, assuming that individuals make choices based solely on their likelihood of being beneficial (e.g., rewarded). However, decisions by both humans and nonhuman animals systematically violate such expectations. Furthermore, the typical experimental paradigm of assessing binary decisions, those between two mutually exclusive options, confounds two aspects common to most group decisions: minimizing uncertainty (through the use of personal and social information) and maintaining group cohesion (for example, to reduce predation risk). Here we experimentally disassociate cohesion-based decisions from information-based decisions using a three-choice paradigm and demonstrate that both factors are crucial to understanding the collective decision making of schooling fish. In addition, we demonstrate how multiple informational dimensions (here color and stripe orientation) are integrated within groups to achieve consensus, even though no individual is explicitly aware of, or has a unique preference for, the consensus option. Balancing of personal information and social cues by individuals in key frontal positions in the group is shown to be essential for such group-level capabilities. Our results demonstrate the importance of integrating informational with other social considerations when explaining the collective capabilities of group-living animals.},

	abstract = {The production of cues that indicate the identity of the sender represents an important aspect of recognition because it may mediate kin recognition and altruism. Although kin recognition cues have often been studied in social insects, only a few studies have reported kin recognition in solitary insects. Furthermore, contrary to cues used for parent–offspring recognition, cues involved in sibling recognition in solitary insects have received far less attention. Here we report that the solitary parasitoid larvae of a non–social insect, Aleochara bilineata Gyll (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), use a chemical cue to recognize their sibs. This cue is present on the plug placed by resident larvae on the host puparium during the parasitization process. When plugs from sib larvae or unrelated larvae are placed on healthy hosts, larvae preferentially parasitize hosts bearing unrelated larvae plugs. When plugs are washed in hexane, larvae no longer display any preference between sib and unrelated larvae plugs. The extraction of the kin recognition chemicals is confirmed by the larval recognition of healthy hosts bearing a hexane extract of sib-parasitized pupae. This nonpolar chemical cue is short lived and is no longer recognized 24 h after having been deposited on the host puparium by larvae. The longevity of the cue used in kin recognition fits precisely the period when a larva may superparasitize a host. The adaptiveness of this cue and its potential source in the larvae are discussed.},

Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation.

Negative gradients, integrated during runs, control the timing of turns. Positive gradients detected through high-amplitude head casts determine the direction of individual turns. By genetically manipulating the peripheral olfactory circuit, we examine how orientation adapts to losses and gains of function in olfactory input. Our findings suggest that larval chemotaxis represents an intermediate navigation strategy between the biased random walks of Escherichia Coli and the stereo-olfaction observed in rats and humans.},

In this systematic approach, the effects of an assortment of food substrates on the development of the larvae were analyzed. C. vomitoria showed much better growth on processed substrates such as beef, pork, turkey, and mixed minced meats than on unprocessed substrates such as beef and pork liver and turkey steak. Beef liver even impeded full development of the species and resulted in death of all individuals. C. vomitoria was therefore categorized as a specialist. Even though mixed minced meat yielded low pupariation rates for C. vicina, the species showed, otherwise, comparable growth rates on all substrates tested and was thus considered to be a generalist.

Adult flies deposit eggs or larvae on the ephemeral food resource, which signals the beginning of intense inter- and intra-species competition. Within a short period of time after egg hatch, large larval aggregations or maggot masses form. A period of intense larval feeding ensues that will culminate with consumption/decomposition of all soft tissues associated with the corpse. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of these feeding aggregations is heat production; that is, the capacity to generate internal heat that can exceed ambient temperatures by 30°C or more. While observations of maggot mass formation and heat generation have been described in the research literature for more than 50 years, our understanding of maggot masses, particularly the physiological ecology of the aggregations as a whole, is rudimentary. In this review, an examination of what is known about the formation of maggot masses is presented, as well as arguments for the physiological benefits and limitations of developing in feeding aggregations that, at times, can represent regions of intense competition, overcrowded conditions, or a microclimate with elevated temperatures approaching or exceeding proteotoxic stress levels.},

	abstract = {(i) This study was undertaken to determine the causal factors and selective mechanisms responsible for the development of the group-feeding behaviour displayed by Neodiprion pratti banksianae Roh. when feeding on the needles of its host, Pinus banksiana Lamb. (ii) Preliminary studies revealed that hatching orientation is constant, all larvae being directed towards the needle tip. Newly-hatched larvae have creamy white head capsules, and are unable to orient to light until an hour after hatching, by which time head capsule pigmentation is well advanced. Egg-bearing needles receive no preferential selection in the establishment of the first feeding sites. (iii) Larval aggregations were found to be consistently too large and too frequent to be accountable by chance, and were seen to be the product of a strong aggregative stimulus. Aggregations formed at wide extremes of light, temperature, and humidity conditions, and were evidently independent of these physical factors. The stimulus to aggregate appeared to remain equally strong throughout larval life, for although the size of the feeding groups diminished, this appeared to be entirely attributable to increasing head capsule size. Larvae displayed no interest in each other when removed from their pine foliage, dispersing in a direct manner on the surface of a grid until their distribution satisfied the Poisson calculations for a randomly dispersed population. Larvae were found to be markedly responsive to the odour of pine foliage, and to the odour of the saliva of feeding insects, and it was postulated that established feeding sites attract additional larvae through an olfactory response. (iv) A small experiment failed to reveal a difference between the rate of development of larvae reared in groups and the rate of development of those larvae that managed to survive in solitary rearings. This same experiment suggested that, although the first instar mortality rate was high in both group and solitary rearings, it might be substantially higher in solitary rearings. Additional studies showed the strong statistical significance of this difference. Mortality was negligible after the moult from first to second instar in both group and solitary rearings. (v) Feeding aggregations were found invariably to form around a feeding site established by an individual larva. So long as this first larva remains alone, the feeding site is restricted to a small portion of the needle periphery along the needle edge. As additional larvae join the site they are at first in close contact with each other, and it can be seen that they are taking advantage of the existing incision to gain purchase in biting into the remaining uncut needle periphery. Once the feeding site is extended beyond the minimum limits imposed by the head capsules the larvae become freely distributed at the feeding site, and no longer maintain close contact. The provision of artificially cut feeding sites significantly increases the establishment of solitary larvae. (vi) It is postulated that the survival advantage gained in the first instar by exploitation of the feeding incisions made by the few larvae that manage to cut into the tough needle cuticle and epidermis is the selective mechanism that has brought about the evolution of group-feeding. (vii) The concept of division of labour is analysed. By "division of labour" we mean, generally, a specialization in various components of a task. Below this is a level where labour is divided as it is within a caste in a complex insect society: by the additive effect of equipotential contributions. Neodiprion larvae are at the threshold of this lower level of division of labour. Their most difficult task in first instar is to establish openings in the pine needles where they may feed, and each larva attempts to do this alone. As soon as individual larvae succeed in establishing feeding sites, individual ef fort by unsuccessful larvae is abandoned in favour of group exploitation. This primitive level of integration foreshadows the continuum of sociality leading to those levels where we may speak of the "survival of the most cooperative".},

	abstract = {Spatial aggregation and association of conspecific and allospecific eggs over resource patches have often been estimated based on emergence data. However, intra-specific competition reduces the number of emergents of conspecifics, and inter-specific competition reduces the number of emergents of allospecifics, causing biases in the estimation of spatial distribution of eggs using emergence data. The present study investigated, by laboratory experiments using drosophilids and simulation models, how the use of emergence data causes such biases. In the laboratory experiments, females were allowed to oviposit over resource patches, and spatial aggregation and association of eggs were examined. The number of emergents from each resource patch was then estimated from the density-survival relationship, and spatial aggregation and association of emerging adults thus estimated were compared with those of eggs. In the simulation models, the spatial distributions of adults emerging from eggs that varied in their degree of spatial aggregation were evaluated under different intensities of intra- and/or inter-specific competition. Both laboratory experiments and simulations indicate that the use of emergence data always causes an underestimation of spatial aggregation and association of eggs. Relaxation of intra- and inter-specific competition by addition of extra resources would improve the estimation of spatial egg distribution based on emergence data.},

Colonists could either directly sample the relative quality of the patches (termed samplers) or, alternatively, they could also use residents as a cue of patch quality (cue-users). Cue-users gained benefit from lowered costs when assessing occupied source patches. The cue-using strategy is an efficient way to choose the best possible patch not only when interspecific competition is intense, but also when benefits from social aggregation exceed the effects of competition. High relative cost of sampling empty patches increases the fitness of the cue-using strategy relative to samplers. The strongest attraction to heterospecifics was predicted when the benefit from aggregating with residents exceeded the effects of competition, and approximately half of the landscape consisted of occupied, high-quality source patches.},

We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals.

To evaluate postmortem intervals (PMIs), one should take into account the determined age of necrophagous flies present on the cadaver. However, PMI determination needs further improvement, and rapid and accurate approaches have therefore to be developed. While previous studies have focussed on insect cuticular hydrocarbons, here we explore the volatile profile released by larvae and pupae of Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae). We monitored changes in volatile compounds daily, by headspace solid-phase microextraction, followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Branched and unbranched hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters and acids were identified, and the volatile profile was shown to vary, in both composition and quantity, with the age of the larva/pupa under investigation. We concluded, based on the analysis of the released volatile organic compounds, that it is possible to increase the accuracy of the estimated PMI, through improved estimation of the age of blowflies present on the cadaver.},

	issn = {0012-9658},
	abstract = {Decision making can be facilitated by observing other individuals faced with the same or similar problem, and recent research suggests that this social information use is a widespread phenomenon. Implications of this are diverse and profound: for example, social information use may trigger cultural evolution, affect distribution and dispersal of populations, and involve intriguing cognitive traits. We emphasize here that social information use is a process consisting of the scenes of (1) event, (2) observation, (3) decision, and (4) consequence, where the initial event is a scene in such a process of another individual. This helps to construct a sound conceptual framework for measuring and studying social information use. Importantly, the potential value of social information is affected by the distance in time, space, and ecology between the initial observation and eventual consequence of a decision. Because negative interactions between individuals (such as direct and apparent competition) also depend on the distance between individuals along these dimensions, the potential value of information and the negative interactions may form a trade-off situation. Optimal solutions to this trade-off can result in adaptively extended social information use, where using information gathered some time ago, some distance away, and from ecologically different individuals is preferred. Conceivably, using information gathered from a heterospecific individual might often be optimal. Many recent studies demonstrate that social information use does occur between species, and the first review of published cases is provided here. Such interaction between species, especially in habitat selection, has important consequences for community ecology and conservation. Adaptively extended social information use may also be an important evolutionary force in guild formation. Complex coevolutionary patterns may result depending on the effect of information use on the provider of information.},

	title = {The principles of collective animal behaviour},
	volume = {361},
	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

	abstract = {In group-living organisms, consensual decision of site selection results from the interplay between individual responses to site characteristics and to group-members. Individuals independently gather personal information by exploring their environment. Through social interaction, the presence of others provides public information that could be used by individuals and modulates the individual probability of joining/leaving a site. The way that individual's information processing and the network of interactions influence the dynamics of public information (depending on population size) that in turn affect discrimination in site quality is a central question. Using binary choice between sheltering sites of different quality, we demonstrate that cockroaches in group dramatically outperform the problem-solving ability of single individual. Such use of public information allows animals to discriminate between alternatives whereas isolated individuals are ineffective (i.e. the personal discrimination efficiency is weak). Our theoretical results, obtained from a mathematical model based on behavioral rules derived from experiments, highlight that the collective discrimination emerges from competing amplification processes relying on the modulation of the individual sheltering time without shelters comparison and communication modulation. Finally, we well demonstrated here the adaptive value of such decision algorithm. Without any behavioral change, the system is able to shift to a more effective strategy when alternatives are present: the modification of the spatio-temporal distributions of individuals leading to the collective selection of the best resource. This collective discrimination implying such parsimonious and widespread mechanism must be shared by many group living-species.},

	abstract = {Many organisms avoid previously exploited patches to increase their foraging efficiency. Such avoidance behavior either requires systematic search, memorizing which patches have been visited, the deposition of a cue or signal that marks exploited patches, or a combination of these abilities. Usually we ascribe patch avoidance behavior to neurologically sophisticated organisms, but here we show identical behavior by a protist—the amoeboid slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This unicellular organism uses an externalized spatial memory system by depositing behind it a trail of extracellular slime. By subjecting amoebae to Y-maze choices, we found that the organism discriminates between slime deposited by conspecifics and heterospecifics and avoids areas where others have been previously. We argue that slime molds use the presence of extracellular slime to preferentially explore novel areas. If the organism perceives the presence of food, it will enter this area even if extracellular slime is present. Thus, extracellular slime does not serve as a repellent but as a cue that an area is most likely devoid of food sources.},

The more beetles in an aggregation, the more quickly the group as a whole responds to the approach of stimuli. Experiments indicate that individual beetles either sight a stimulus themselves, or respond to waves generated by fleeing conspecifics. The distance between two beetles is important in determining how quickly a blinded beetle reacts to wave cues. Two hypotheses can explain the warning mechanism used by aggregations. (1) A high contact rate between aggregation members leads to increased physiological arousal which allows more rapid individual response, or (2) Environmental scanning is enhanced with the addition of more eyes to the group. Evidence from laboratory experiments supports the latter explanation.},

	abstract = {Aggregations of lady beetles, predominately Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunctata, were commonly observed on the shores of lakes in the Upper Midwest during the autumn and spring. The beetles remain on the shore for only a short time, usually dispersing within 2-3 weeks. Lady bettles from autumn shore aggregations and overwintering aggregations are characterized by the presence of large amounts of fat, reproductive inactivitiy, empty digestive tracts, a skew in the sex ratio favoring females and the behavioral tendency to form aggregations. Hippodamia convergens, the most commonly observed coccinellid in shore aggregations, undergoes long migratory flights to and from overwintering sites in California. It is suggested that similar migratory activity occurs in the Upper Midwest and that during these flights the beetles may be blown into the water and washed ashore, thus forming the aggregations. However, in contrast with the overwintering aggregations in California, the shore aggregations reported in this study appear to be temporary shoreline collections and not the overwintering site.},

Likewise, the spatial aggregation between members of insects societies plays a crucial role in social cohesion and division of labor, namely, in polymorphic ant species. In the present paper, we show caste-specific aggregation patterns in the strictly dimorphic Pheidole pallidula ant species. We investigate the influence on the clustering of ants exerted by direct contacts between nest mates as well as by indirect cues through chemical marking. In a homogeneous environment deprived of chemical cues, majors show a higher aggregation level than minors and a centripetal behavior. By contrast, minors are more scattered in the experimental arena and display a centrifugal behavior. In addition, area marking laid by minors enhances their own aggregative behavior while contributing to the localization of the spontaneously aggregating majors. Such differences in aggregative patterns as well as their adaptive value have to be coupled with the mobility level and the task performance efficiency of each worker caste. Contrary to majors that are likely to aggregate, highly mobile minors, scattered inside and outside the nest colony, can detect colony needs and can carry out most of the daily tasks for which they are more efficient than majors.},

Haemaphysalis longicornis were primarily segregated from H. megaspinosa by season. All stages of the 2 tick species preferred sedges. Three-way contingency tables and log-linear models were used to test for independence of occurrence and to quantify associations between species and stages with similar host ranges. The shifts of questing site from leaves to stem tips and from 40–49 cm to greater heights were observed in both species, which suggests that these sites are more suitable for ticks and that aggregation may serve as protection from severe conditions. In contrast, a shift to a lower height was observed in H. longicornis nymphs and larvae when other species were present, suggesting that they were driven away by other species, especially H. megaspinosa. Heterospecific clusters composed of at least 2 species were formed on stem tips more frequently. It is concluded that questing site was affected by both aggregation pattern and the presence of other species.},

	volume = {61},
	abstract = {In this paper I combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that aggregation of carrion flies ovipositing among carcasses may facilitate coexistence in nature. The paper is divided into an experimental part and a theoretical part. In the experiment part, I present field experiments that show the aggregative pattern of carrion flies ovipositing among carcasses, as well as associated experiments that explore the behavior leading to these patterns. I also use experiments to quantify the strength of larval competition between Phaenicia coeruleiviridis (Calliphoridae) and Sarcophaga bullata (Sarcophagidae). In the theoretical part, I develop two methods that use these data to assess the effect of aggregation on competition in the field. From the first method, I predict that intraspecific aggregation of P. coeruleiviridis females causes a 26\% decrease in the expected recruitment of P. coeruleiviridis and a 74\% increase in the expected recruitment of S. bullata. As a result, within a single generation, intraspecific aggregation increases intraspecific competition and reduces interspecific competition. The second method for assessing aggregation involves a new mathematical formula that gives conditions under which species may coexist indefinitely. This formula requires estimates of only the degrees of intra- and interspecific aggregation among species; there is no need to estimate adult survival and larval competition. I use this second method to show that the minimum effect of aggregation on coexistence for five carrion fly species is equivalent to reducing the amount of larval competition between pairs of species by an average of 57\%. Aggregation may therefore play a major role in explaining the coexistence of carrion fly competitors.},

In the laboratory, we determined the feeding and oviposition responses of a ladybird predator to its conspecific and heterospecific competitors in an aphidophagous guild. Gravid females of Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) reduced oviposition, but not feeding, when exposed to immobilised conspecific or Coccinella transversalis (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) individuals in the short-term (3 h) and long-term (24 h). Feeding and oviposition responses were not affected when M. sexmaculatus females were exposed to larvae or adults of Scymnus pyrocheilus Mulsant (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) beetles or larvae of the syrphid fly Ischiodon scutellaris (Fabricius) (Diptera: Syrphidae). The ratio of eggs laid to numbers of aphids consumed by M. sexmaculatus females was also affected by the presence of conspecific or C. transversalis larvae. The results suggest that fecundity of this predator may be affected by both conspecific and heterospecific competitors in a patchy resource.},

Calliphora vomitoria colonised baits buried at 5 cm but no deeper whilst C. vicina and L. sericata colonised remains at 10 cm but not at 20 cm. The baits were colonised by larvae hatching from eggs laid on the surface of the soil. Both C. vomitoria and L. sericata were able to develop from eggs through to adulthood on baits that were infested before being buried and the larvae developed at similar rates and pupariated at similar depths to larvae developing on baits on the soil surface. The muscid flies Muscina stabulans (Fallén) and Muscina prolapsa (Harris) colonised remains buried in loose soil at a depth of 40 cm and even when presented with baits on the soil surface their larvae tended to remain in the soil beneath the baits. In compacted soil, M. stabulans colonised baits buried at 10 cm but M. prolapsa only colonised those buried at 5 cm. In both muscid species, the adult flies were instantly attracted to feed on fresh blood and laid eggs in the soil above buried baits within 30 min of them being introduced into the cages. The adult muscid flies did not attempt to burrow into the soil and their larvae colonised the baits from eggs laid on the soil surface. This information could be useful in determining whether a body was stored above ground before being buried and/or the time since burial occurred.},

	abstract = {The growth characteristics of the larvae of the major members of a necrophagous fly guild in Tasmania (Lucilia cuprina, Calliphora stygia, Calliphora vicina and Calliphora hilli) were measured to assess their competitive ability. The measurements were made at temperatures between 10 and 45°C, to cover the range of temperatures that would be encountered by larvae in carrion or myiasis under field conditions. The characteristics measured were net production and respiration. The indices K2i (instantaneous growth efficiency), K2c (cumulated growth efficiency) and Mi (instantaneous cost of maintenance) were calculated. Generally K2c and K2i are highest and Mi lowest at 25°C for all the species. A sinusoidal response in K2c, K2i and Mi against temperature is seen for L. cuprina, C. stygia and C. vicina. This response is‘cold’adapted in the Calliphora species and‘warm’adapted in L. cuprina. Egg size, egg caloric density and the energy content of the eggs are discussed in relation to the‘fitness’and reproductive strategies of the four species. The thermal tolerance range of L. cuprina determined here suggests that carrion may provide a significant number of this fly particularly in areas where Chrysomya spp. do not occur, and in large carcasses where temperatures are elevated.},

	abstract = {Chemotaxis is a powerful paradigm to study how orientation behavior is driven by sensory stimulation. Drosophila larvae navigate odor gradients by controlling the duration of their runs and the direction of their turns. Straight runs and wide-amplitude turns represent two extremes of a behavioral continuum. Here we establish that, on average, runs curl toward the direction of higher odor concentrations. We find that the orientation and strength of the local odor gradient perpendicular to the direction of motion modulates the orientation of individual runs in a gradual manner. We discuss how this error-correction mechanism, called weathervaning, contributes to larval chemotaxis. We use larvae with a genetically modified olfactory system to demonstrate that unilateral function restricted to a single olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) is sufficient to direct weathervaning. Our finding that bilateral sensing is not necessary to control weathervaning highlights the role of temporal sampling. A correlational analysis between sensory inputs and behavioral outputs suggests that weathervaning results from low-amplitude head casts implemented without interruption of the run. In addition, we report the involvement of a sensorimotor memory arising from previous reorientation events. Together, our results indicate that larval chemotaxis combines concurrent orientation strategies that involve complex computations on different timescales.},

	abstract = {For many years, field studies of birds have suggested that territorial individuals may be attracted to one another, forming territorial clusters independent of resource distributions. However, virtually no experiments have studied these phenomena in either the laboratory or the field. The present field study was designed to test whether prospective territory owners preferentially settle near conspecifics and form territorial aggregations when territory quality is held constant. Juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards arriving at juvenile habitats in clearings were given a choice of artificial homesites arranged around a clear-walled enclosure divided into two parts, one of which contained resident A. aeneus juveniles. Juveniles showed a clear preference for the homesites adjacent to the established territorial residents (the "experimental" homesites). In each of eight trials, the first arrivals appeared on the experimental homesites. Juveniles that first appeared on the experimental homesites were more apt to settle in the clearing, and colonists on the experimental side moved around less before choosing a final territory. During the colonization process, juveniles spent more time on the experimental sides of the enclosures; and by the end of the trials, more juveniles had eventually settled on the experimental homesites. Throughout the settlement process, new territory owners tended to cluster around the previous residents within the experimental side of the enclosures. These results indicate that A. aeneus juveniles are attracted to conspecifics while settling a territory and that this process can lead to territorial aggregations that are independent of territory quality.},

	issn = {1662-4548},
	abstract = {In many species of group living invertebrates, in particular arthropods, collective decisions can emerge from the combined actions of individuals and the direct or indirect interactions between individuals. These decisions allow groups of individuals to respond quickly and accurately to changes that occur in their environment. Examples of such decisions are found in a variety of invertebrate taxa and in many different contexts, e.g., exploring a new territory, foraging for food, finding a suitable location where to aggregate or to establish a nest, defending oneself against predators, etc. In this paper we review the collective decisions that have been documented in different invertebrate taxa where individuals are known to live temporarily or permanently in social or gregarious groups. We first present some simple examples of collective decisions involving the choice between two alternatives. We then define the fundamental rules required for these collective decisions to emerge throughout the invertebrate taxon, from simple organisms such as caterpillars, to animals endowed with highly developed perceptive and cognitive capacities such as ants and bees. The presentation of these rules gives us the opportunity to illustrate one of the pitfalls of the study of collective choice in animals by showing through computer simulations how a choice between two alternatives can be misinterpreted as the result of the action of self-organized mechanisms. In the second part, we discuss the peculiarities of collective decisions in invertebrates, their properties, and characteristics. We conclude by discussing the issue of individual complexity in collective decision-making process.},

This daily dispersal and nightly reformation of clusters is correlated with two temperature-sensitive behaviours. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that ladybird beetles become photopositive as the temperature in a controlled environment room decreases from 20 C to 7 C, but they revert to a photonegative response as the temperature falls below 5 C. Also, ladybird beetles tend to form clusters as the temperature falls from 35 C to about 15 C. An attractant pheromone assists in cluster formation. Possible selective advantages of cluster formation by ladybird beetles are discussed.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {The last decades have seen an increasing interest in modeling collective animal behavior. Some studies try to reproduce as accurately as possible the collective dynamics and patterns observed in several animal groups with biologically plausible, individual behavioral rules. The objective is then essentially to demonstrate that the observed collective features may be the result of self-organizing processes involving quite simple individual behaviors. Other studies concentrate on the objective of establishing or enriching links between collective behavior researches and cognitive or physiological ones, which then requires that each individual rule be carefully validated. Here we discuss the methodological consequences of this additional requirement. Using the example of corpse clustering in ants, we first illustrate that it may be impossible to discriminate among alternative individual rules by considering only observational data collected at the group level. Six individual behavioral models are described: They are clearly distinct in terms of individual behaviors, they all reproduce satisfactorily the collective dynamics and distribution patterns observed in experiments, and we show theoretically that it is strictly impossible to discriminate two of these models even in the limit of an infinite amount of data whatever the accuracy level. A set of methodological steps are then listed and discussed as practical ways to partially overcome this problem. They involve complementary experimental protocols specifically designed to address the behavioral rules successively, conserving group-level data for the overall model validation. In this context, we highlight the importance of maintaining a sharp distinction between model enunciation, with explicit references to validated biological concepts, and formal translation of these concepts in terms of quantitative state variables and fittable functional dependences. Illustrative examples are provided of the benefits expected during the often long and difficult process of refining a behavioral model, designing adapted experimental protocols and inversing model parameters.},

A large diversity of species has developed kin recognition abilities, allowing individuals to discriminate conspecifics in relation to relatedness. In social insects, many studies showed that discrimination generally acts at the level of nestmateship and only few studies report kin recognition abilities. Our results highlight the importance of kin recognition in shaping social life in the urban cockroach Blattella germanica (L.) and present a complete description of the recognition system from expression to action components. Cockroaches of all developmental stages (nymphs and adults) discriminate siblings from nonsiblings independently of any prior social experience. Preference is context dependent so that siblings are preferred as social partners, whereas nonsiblings are preferred as mating partners. Discrimination is based on quantitative differences of cuticular hydrocarbons that are perceived through antennal contacts. As individual cuticular profiles remain stable over time, they constitute reliable discrimination cues correlated with relatedness. Our results offer interesting perspectives for the study of kin recognition and for the understanding of evolution toward sociality in insects.},

	abstract = {During outbreaks, locust swarms can contain millions of insects travelling thousands of kilometers while devastating vegetation and crops. Such large-scale spatial organization is preceded locally by a dramatic density-dependent phenotypic transition in multiple traits. Behaviourally, low-density ‘solitarious’ individuals avoid contact with one another; above a critical local density, they undergo a rapid behavioural transition to the ‘gregarious phase’ whereby they exhibit mutual attraction. Although proximate causes of this phase polyphenism have been widely studied, the ultimate driving factors remain unclear. Using an individual-based evolutionary model, we reveal that cannibalism, a striking feature of locust ecology, could lead to the evolution of density-dependent behavioural phase-change in juvenile locusts. We show that this behavioural strategy minimizes risk associated with cannibalistic interactions and may account for the empirically observed persistence of locust groups during outbreaks. Our results provide a parsimonious explanation for the evolution of behavioural plasticity in locusts.},

This study was designed to test the effects of six household products (bleach, mosquito repellent, perfume, caustic soda, insecticide and unleaded gasoline) on blowfly (Lucilia sericata, Diptera: Calliphoridae) larval development. Furthermore, the effects of climate (rain or dry conditions) on larval development were analyzed. For each replication, 100 first instars were placed on a rat cadaver on which one household product was spilled. We observed a decrease in the survival rates of the larvae but no significant effect on their development times or the adult size. The same trends were observed under rainy conditions. However, the rain altered the effects of some tested household products, especially gasoline. These results demonstrate for the first time the successful development of necrophagous larvae on chemically contaminated cadavers, and provide evidence for the range of possible effects to expect.},

	shorttitle = {Examination of forensic entomology evidence using computed tomography scanning},
	abstract = {A new technique has recently been developed for estimating the volume of maggot masses on deceased persons using post-mortem CT scans. This allows volume to be measured non-invasively and factored into maggot mass temperature calculations for both casework and research. Examination of admission scans also allows exploration of entomological evidence in anatomical areas not usually exposed by autopsy (e.g. nasal cavities and facial sinuses), and before autopsy disrupts the maggot distribution on a body. This paper expands on work already completed by providing the x-ray attenuation coefficient by way of Hounsfield unit (HU) values for various maggot species, maggot masses and human tissue adjacent to masses. Specifically, this study looked at the HU values for four forensically important blowfly larvae: Lucilia cuprina, L. sericata, Calliphora stygia and C. vicina. The Calliphora species had significantly lower HU values than the Lucilia species. This might be explained by histological analysis, which revealed a non-significant trend, suggesting that Calliphora maggots have a higher fat content than the Lucilia maggots. It is apparent that the variation in the x-ray attenuation coefficient usually precludes its use as a tool for delineating the maggot mass from human tissue and that morphology is the dominant method for delineating a mass. This paper also includes three case studies, which reveal different applications for interpreting entomological evidence using post-mortem CT scans.},

Basic Yellow™ delayed development and adult emergence while RedWop™ and Yellow Powder™ had a significant effect on particular stages of development, however, emergence time was not altered. Optimal administration is through ingestion at low concentration levels ({\textless}10\%) or topically, with GreenWop™ demonstrating minimal adverse effects. Optimum wavelength for discrimination between powders was 450 nm. This research can aid in investigative training to increase visibility of larval and pupal blow flies. It can also be used in entomological studies to differentiate between larval blow flies (or other dipteran) species or individuals to further understand complex interactions and behavior during larval development.},

various body regions to identify the site of mechanosensory input that
elicits the transition to gregarious phase behavior. The phase state of
individual insects was measured after a 4-h period of localized

logistic regression analysis. A significant switch from solitarious to
gregarious behavior occurred when the outer face of a hind femur had
been stimulated, but mechanical stimulation of 10 other body regions
did not result in significant behavioral change. We conclude that a
primary cause of the switch in behavior that seeds the formation of

In our model, colonists assessing potential breeding patches could select between high-quality source and low-quality sink patches. A proportion of the source patches were occupied by residents. Colonists could either directly sample the relative quality of the patches (termed samplers) or, alternatively, they could also use residents as a cue of patch quality (cue-users). Cue-users gained benefit from lowered costs when assessing occupied source patches. The cue-using strategy is an efficient way to choose the best possible patch not only when interspecific competition is intense, but also when benefits from social aggregation exceed the effects of competition. High relative cost of sampling empty patches increases the fitness of the cue-using strategy relative to samplers. The strongest attraction to heterospecifics was predicted when the benefit from aggregating with residents exceeded the effects of competition, and approximately half of the landscape consisted of occupied, high-quality source patches.},

	abstract = {Aggregation and species association of 9 species of phytophagous and
predaceous mites were studied for 6 yr in an orchard with 100, 2 m tall 'Red
Delicious' apple trees. To quantify aggregation, a method was developed that is
powerful, and easily interpreted. It relates the proportion of habitat occupied to
mean density of the organism, and allows discrimination of aggregation differences
between data sets.
We found that plant feeders were more aggregated than predators, and
active life stages were less aggregated than eggs. Specifically, webspinning spider
mites (Tetranychus urticae + Eotetranychus sp.) were the most aggregated.
Panonychus ulmi was less aggregated than the webspinning mites, and Bryobia
rubrioculus was the least aggregated of the spider mites. Zetzellia mali, the slowest
moving predator, had the greatest aggregation of all the predators. The rapid moving phytoseiids were the least aggregated of all the mite species studied, with
the specialist predator Metaseiulus occidentalis having the greatest aggregation, the
generalist predator Typhlodromus pyri having medium aggregation, and the fast
moving Amblyseius andersoni having the least aggregation.
Predator-predator, predator-prey, and prey-prey associations were measured using Yule's V association index. Predator-predator associations were the strongest and most consistent, showing a consistent seasonal pattern of neutral-negativeneutral association. Negative associations of T. pyri with other predators were the strongest, which is consistent with evidence that this mite can detect other predators. Predator-prey seasonal associations were weak and mixed, and interactions between prey species were generally weakly positive, probably because of similar habitat preferences.
Predaceous mites were generally more aggregated when competing with other predators, possibly allowing the coexistence of 3 predators simultaneously for 6 years via mechanisms proposed by the "aggregation theory of coexistence". G. occidentalis showed the greatest change of aggregation when other predators were present, Z. mali and T. pyri also showed significant changes in aggregation when they were with other predators, but A. andersoni (the largest, fastest predator in our study) showed no changes in aggregation. T. pyri's aggregation increased the most when in the presence of Z. mali, perhaps because of egg predation by the stigmaeid, or because T. pyri could detect the other predator.},

Yet, since these isopods are positively hygrokinetic even at very high humidities, their hygroreaction is of greater significance than their photoreaction.In isopods from mesic habitats (Oniscus, Porcellio, Armadillidium) photoreaction becomes of less significance than in littoral species, until in some species it reverts to positive (Armadillidium). Sometimes the positive photoreaction occurs only at high temperatures (Porcellio), a pattern of behavior correlated with thermoregulation by evaporative cooling. Similarly, in mesic species the response to humidity becomes less significant than in littoral species, resuming importance mainly when the isopods become dehydrated (Armadillidium).Finally, in isopods from xeric habitats in semi-arid and desert regions (Armadillo, Venezillo), photoreaction is strongly negative except in Hemilepistus at lower temperatures. All of these isopods are positively hygrokinetic only at low humidities and are strongly negatively thermoactive, indicating a drop in activity at high temperatures.

One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

The dual-choice wind tunnel appeared as a "T-box," consisting of two stimulus partitions and one median release partition. The correlation between wind speed and fly response showed a marked relationship, with the wind speed set at 0.5 m/s being the optimal speed. Of the 72 natural products tested, 24--all having high protein content--attracted flies at the level of greater than 50\% in the rearing cages during preliminary tests, thus allowing further investigation in the dual-choice wind tunnel to further assess these responses. The behavioral response between flies exposed to the screening odors in a rearing cage and those exposed in the dual-choice wind tunnel showed a similar trend. One-day-tainted pork viscera yielded the greatest positive response among natural products tested, attracting greater than 90\% of the flies included in the test population. One-day-tainted pork viscera exhibited the highest potency (1.578), exceeding 1-day-tainted beef liver, which is commonly used as the standard bait for blowflies. The usefulness and practical applications of the dual-choice wind tunnel for further investigations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The terminal organs of the cephalic lobes of the house fly larva, Musca domestica L., were studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Six different types of sensilla were found: (1) papilla sensillum, (2) pit sensillum, (3) spot sensillum, (4) modified papilla sensillum, (5) knob sensillum, and (6) scolopidium. The papilla, pit, spot, and modified papilla sensilla have the essential structure of contact chemoreceptors, i.e., the unbranched dendritic tips are exposed externally through a single opening. However, a tubular body, which is a characteristic structure of tactile setae, is also present in some of the dendritic tips. We assume these sensilla serve a dual function—contact chemo- and mechanoreception. The role of the knob sensilla is obscure. The scolopidia present in the dorsal and the terminal organ are probably stress detectors. Two basal bodies occur in the dendritic ciliary region of all sensilla. Both of the basal bodies (except in the scolopidia) give rise to the distal ciliary microtubules as well as the proximal rootlets.},

	abstract = {Hypotheses proposed to explain the formation of mixed-species foraging groups have focused on both foraging and antipredation benefits. Mixed-species flocks of bark-foraging birds form during the winter in the eastern deciduous forests of North America. These flocks are composed of two parid nuclear species, tufted titmice,Baeolophus bicolor, and either Carolina or black-capped chickadees,Poecile carolinensisorP. atricapillus, and several satellite species including downy woodpeckers,Picoides pubescens, and white-breasted nuthatches,Sitta carolinensis. The parid nuclear species seem to act as flock leaders and are closely followed by the satellite species. To elucidate what advantages downy woodpeckers and white-breasted nuthatches gain by flocking with parids, we removed parids from eight Ohio woodlots isolated by surrounding agricultural fields and compared the woodpeckers and nuthatches in these woodlots to those in eight controls. We tested four predictions generated by group-foraging hypotheses: compared with controls, satellite birds in treatment woodlots should (1) forage more in microclimates that reduce metabolic costs, (2) increase their vigilance, (3) exhibit reduced nutritional condition and (4) exhibit higher mortality rates. As predicted, female downy woodpeckers in treatment woodlots tended to forage in locations that were more sheltered from wind, presumably thereby reducing metabolic costs. Treatment males and females of both species significantly increased their vigilance. Finally, in the absence of parids, male nuthatches showed significantly reduced nutritional condition according to ptilochronology analysis of feathers grown during the experimental manipulation, and tended to exhibit increased mortality},

	abstract = {Gustatory stimuli have at least 2 kinds of function: They can support immediate, reflexive responses (such as substrate choice and feeding) and they can drive internal reinforcement. We provide behavioral analyses of these functions with respect to sweet taste in larval Drosophila. The idea is to use the dose–effect characteristics as behavioral “fingerprints” to dissociate reflexive and reinforcing functions. For glucose and trehalose, we uncover relatively weak preference. In contrast, for fructose and sucrose, preference responses are strong and the effects on feeding pronounced. Specifically, larvae are attracted to, and feeding is stimulated most strongly for, intermediate concentrations of either sugar: Using very high concentrations (4 M) results in weakened preference and suppression of feeding. In contrast to such an optimum function regarding choice and feeding, an asymptotic dose–effect function is found for reinforcement learning: Learning scores reach asymptote at 2 M and remain stable for a 4-M concentration. A similar parametric discrepancy between the reflexive (choice and feeding) and reinforcing function is also seen for sodium chloride (Niewalda T, Singhal S, Fiala A, Saumweber T, Wegener S, Gerber B, in preparation). We discuss whether these discrepancies are based either on inhibition from high-osmolarity sensors upon specifically the reflexive pathways or whether different sensory pathways, with different effective dose–response characteristics, may have preferential access to drive either reflex responses or modulatory neurons mediating internal reinforcement, respectively.},

	abstract = {The tortuosity of an animal's path is a key parameter in orientation and searching behaviours. The tortuosity of an oriented path is inversely related to the efficiency of the orientation mechanism involved, the best mechanism being assumed to allow the animal to reach its goal along a straight line movement. The tortuosity of a random search path controls the local searching intensity, allowing the animal to adjust its search effort to the local profitability of the environment. This paper shows that (1) the efficiency of an oriented path can be reliably estimated by a straightness index computed as the ratio between the distance from the starting point to the goal and the path length travelled to reach the goal, but such a simple index, ranging between 0 and 1, cannot be applied to random search paths; (2) the tortuosity of a random search path, ranging between straight line movement and Brownian motion, can be reliably estimated by a sinuosity index which combines the mean cosine of changes of direction with the mean step length; and (3) in the current state of the art, the fractal analysis of animals’ paths, which may appear as an alternative and promising way to measure the tortuosity of a random search path as a fractal dimension ranging between 1 (straight line movement) and 2 (Brownian motion), is only liable to generate artifactual results. This paper also provides some help for distinguishing between oriented and random search paths, and depicts a general, comprehensive framework for analysing individual animals’ paths in a two-dimensional space.},

	abstract = {This study tested whether lines of Japanese quails divergently selected for a fear response, the tonic immobility, might constitute a reliable bird model for studying anxiety. Previous studies demonstrated that the selection modifies the general underlying emotionality of the birds rather than exerting its effect only on tonic immobility. The behavioural effects of intraperitoneal injections of diazepam, an anxiolytic drug, were assessed in two lines of quail selected either for their short (STI) or long (LTI) duration of tonic immobility. Effects of diazepam were examined in two tests used for measuring emotionality in birds, the open field and the tonic immobility tests. After being placed in the centre of the open field, birds with a high emotionality (LTI quails) stayed longer in the centre of the apparatus than STI quail. Diazepam had anxiolytic effect in LTI birds as it increased the time spent in the outer area. This effect of diazepam appears to be selective because the drug has no effect on other behaviours such as distress calls or escape attempts. The drug has also no effect on the tonic immobility response in any of the two lines. These findings reveal an “anxiogenic” trait of LTI birds in the open field test that can be modulated by the administration of an anxiolytic drug. Therefore quails selected for LTI and STI represent a valuable model to study the mechanisms underlying anxiety in birds.},

Standard fixation methods frequently fail because fixatives do not penetrate the cuticle rapidly, resulting in distortion and generation of artifacts on the surface. A freeze-substitution technique that produces excellent preservation of the larval stages of a wide variety of Diptera is described. The method employs Freon 12 for rapid freezing of the specimens and methanol as the substitution fluid. The technique is simple, inexpensive, and demonstrates a significant improvement in preservation of specimens., Il est souvent difficile d'obtenir des préparations parfaites de larves de diptères pour l'examen au microscope électronique à balayage. Les méthodes usuelles de fixation sont souvent inadéquates parce que les agents fixateurs ne réussissent pas à pénétrer la cuticule assez rapidement, ce qui entraîne de la distorsion et l'apparition d'artéfacts à la surface. On trouvera ici la description d'une méthode de congélation qui permet de conserver parfaitement les stades larvaires d'un grand nombre de diptères. Cette méthode utilise le Fréon 12 pour une congélation rapide des spécimens et le méthanol sert de liquide intermédiaire. La méthode est simple, économique, et elle constitue un grand progrès dans la conservation des spécimens.[Traduit par la revue]},
